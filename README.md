# DadAI â€“ An LLM-based assistant for new dads ðŸ¤–ðŸ‘¶

**DadAI** is an open-source project built to support new fathers during pregnancy and early parenthood.  
The idea is simple: provide emotionally intelligent, practical guidance powered by LLMs â€” and built on **Mistral 7B**.

## ðŸš€ Why DadAI?

Most resources around parenting are either mother-centric or scattered across forums.  
DadAI aims to provide a clear, AI-driven interface that supports:
- Emotional support during pregnancy
- Concrete actions and reminders
- Guidance on sleep, communication, and partner well-being

## ðŸ§  Tech Stack

- [x] Mistral 7B (quantized with GGUF)
- [x] LoRA fine-tuning with QLoRA
- [x] Python (Transformers, PEFT, Datasets)
- [x] Deployment via [LocalAI](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI)
- [ ] Web interface (optional â€“ future)
