{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Signing off as a NewDad. I have just one piece of advice\n\nI've been meaning to get off Reddit for a while now - but it's been the few great communities like this one that have kept me on. \n\nBut I don't feel like a new dad any more - my youngest is 15 months and my oldest is about to start JK in September.\n\nWhen I think about him starting school, I'm feeling my stomach turn. It's a cliche, but it's true: the time goes so fast that you're blindsided.\n\nLooking back on the last 4.5 years, my one piece of advice is this: **treasure these days.** \n\nThere are hard parts, very fucking hard parts. And you don't have to pretend to like those. We all take joy in the milestones - the first smile, first steps, first words. But don't take the mundane for granted. The 78th super early morning where it's just you and the baby. The millionth trip to the park. \n\nThere's going to be a day, and you won't have that many birthdays before it comes, when that little one isn't a little one any more. And it might not feel like it now, but you'll feel a pang for those days. But they'll be gone like cotton candy in the bathtub, to use an example my son enjoys illustrating.\n\nYou'll never get them back - but you have them right in front of you now. Don't let the hard parts make you forget that you're living days you'll look back on with a smile in 5, 15 and 50 years. Drink it in.\n\nBest of luck guys. As we like to say around here, you've got this.\n\nR\u00e9ponse du papa :", "completion": ">There are hard parts, very fucking hard parts.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : I spent $3000 on anger therapy as a new dad. Worth it.\n\nBasically had severe anger issues coming into the first few weeks as a new dad. People who know me will say I am very chill dude so this came as a surprise.After a couple of episodes I realised I needed therapy or I might lose my marriage/family.\n\nNine sessions later I realised I have deep-seated self-esteem issues due to childhood trauma. I get triggered into rage with criticism, and with a new baby this is of course fertile ground.\n\nIn any case, I know I can't be alone in this journey, and not everyone has the time/resource to take therapy so I'm passing some techniques on for anyone who is struggling.\n\n**1. C.R.A.P**  \n**Criticism, Rejection, Abandonment, Perfectionism**  \nThese are the four horsemen of the anger apocalypse. Learn to identify them and treat them like four old pals who ride into a room when a triggering situation appears. Learn to smirk at them and say : \"ah yea, it's you again, ye old cunt. What doth thou want from me now?\" Like mirages, they don't bear the weight of scrutiny and tend to vanish pretty quick.\n\n**2. THE FORK IN THE ROAD.**  \nAt every decision there is a choice: to react negatively and launch into a defensive pattern, or do the thing that leads to a person you value yourself to be (aka: don't react, consider the possibility that you might be gasp...wrong). Therapist told me: \"BOTH of these routes will lead to pain and anguish. But ONE of them leads to a better situation.\" This was a revelation. Once I saw this as a fork in the road, it was easier to take the path to a better me.\n\n**3. DROP THE ANCHOR.** This is a technique where when you see red, you immediately \"drop anchor\" and name three things you can see, three things you can hear, see, taste, smell, touch. Say them softly to yourself and repeat for a few minutes. Your blood pressure will tank.\n\n**4. THE SHAPE OF RAGE**  \nClose your eyes and try to detect where the anger is in your body. For me it felt like a red hot iron \"axe-head\" shape on my chest with razor tendrils going up the inside of my throat. It was extremely uncomfortable. Try to deduce the colour, texture, material of this shape, breathing in and out slowly. After some minutes, I found the metallic-ness of the axe head became plastic, then transparent, then thin like gossamer. I realised that all feelings are transient and if I had acted during that period where the axe head was the most \"solid\" I would have acted in accordance with a bloody mirage. Silly!\n\nAnyway those are the the main points. Not even sure if anyone cares to upvote this, but if I get enough I might add a couple more.\n\nHappy parenting!\n\nEdit: A word.\n\nR\u00e9ponse du papa :", "completion": "Thank you for sharing, this is really interesting.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Last night was the scariest night of my life\n\nMy wife and I welcomed our second child, our first son into the world yesterday at 6:36pm. So this story has a happy ending...but I'm still a bit shaken up and just wanted to get it off my chest. \n My wife had gestational diebities so her midwife induced her at 39 weeks. So we knew the date he was going to be here. We were planning everything weeks/months in advance. My wife had a birth plan and wanted to go as natural as possible. Her first pregnancy she felt like choices during delivery were taken from her and wanted this time to be different. Of course I agree, it's a intense experience and the feeling of control can help in the moment. However I reminded her constantly that being flexible in the moment would make the unexpected easier to manage. \n\nThe day of everything is going great. We're at the 20hr mark and she's stuck to her plan. She's laboring and progressing perfectly. Handling contractions as well as anyone can but there wasn't any point when she asked for pain meds and had to be talked out of it. I couldn't have been more proud of her strength. \nWe got to the point when her water broke which was a big milestone moment for her bc that was one of the moments that got taken from her the first time. Contractions picked way up after that. Bc of her diabetes she had movement and heart monitors on her at all times and it became apparent to the nurses and midwives that during every contraction baby's heart rate dropped significantly. I was so focused on my wife and coaching her through the contractions I wasn't making the connection that the slowing beeping that was happening the background was a bad sign. Or that the looks on the nurses and midwife faces were growing more concerned. My wife noticed though. Through everything she was going through she started asking \"what's happening? Is he okay? What's wrong!?\"\nThen within 5-10minutes a doctor came in and said we needed to get the baby out immediately, a group of nurses rushed in and unplugged all her cords and monitors, and our midwife quickly explained that during contractions the baby's heartrate dropped significantly and they needed to do something now. \nI rushed to my visibility terrified wife's side. Told her I loved her. kissed her. Told her she was going to be safe. Our son was going to be safe. And if I'm being honest that felt like a lie because I didn't know in that moment that they would. Almost as soon as I finished saying those words she was pushed out of the room and down the hall door an emergency C Section. I was told someone would get me if I could be in the room. Five minutes later someone came to tell me I wouldn't be allowed in the room and someone would be back to give me an update. \nI was trying to remind myself to be flexible. This was just one of those unexpected situations. But my mind went to the darkest future. I don't really want to detail that future but I will say I was alone in that room sobbing for over 30 minutes until someone finally came to tell me our boy was safe and healthy and my wife was being stitched back up and that everyone was going to be fine. \n\nThe three of us have been in the recovery ward all day together reeling from the experience. Her and I have been periodically breaking down throughout the day this processing the feeling like we almost lost each other. I know that's not reality. I've been holding our boy I'm so grateful for him. I still feel like I'm going to need to crawl into bed when I get home and sob until this dread leaves my body.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Wife has PPD, baby is colicky, I\u2019m starting to crumble\n\nNot sure if there\u2019s any advice to give so partially just venting.\n\nMy son was born three weeks ago and has been very healthy after a stretch in the NICU. He\u2019s still trying to figure out pooping sometimes and his nights/days are backwards, but overall he\u2019s not the hard of a kid (relatively speaking). My wife, however, has been struggling since the start. She was hospitalized only three days after we brought him home because she was having constant panic attacks and didn\u2019t feel safe around baby. Her family moved themselves into our house when she was admitted. This is great for her, but I don\u2019t like people in my space other than my wife. I\u2019ve felt uncomfortable in my own home for weeks, feeling like a guest in someone else\u2019s house. It\u2019s both a social thing and an OCD issue - both of which have gotten worse the longer they\u2019ve been here.\n\nAnyways, yesterday was my birthday and my wife completely melted down. She admitted to having suicidal thoughts which is obviously scary to hear. We talked to her psychiatrist and they didn\u2019t want to admit her again and take her away from baby if there wasn\u2019t any intent (which I agreed with), but I don\u2019t want her in the house right now either. She doesn\u2019t know it because I\u2019ve been taking care of the baby mostly solo, but he\u2019s officially hit the colicky/purple crying phase. I definitely don\u2019t want her around while that\u2019s happening to add to her stress. I told her and her mom to get a hotel nearby so she can get some quality sleep and detach from the situation. Her aunt had finally left on Sunday but the only way my wife would agree to the hotel plan is if her aunt came back and stayed with me at the house. I know it makes her feel more comfortable so I said yes, despite knowing that it won\u2019t help me.\n\nTo add some additional context to all of this, I\u2019ve basically been a single parent in every sense so far. I\u2019ve been taking the full night shift so my wife can sleep and only getting about 3 hours myself in the morning. I\u2019m sleep deprived as hell and obviously very on edge. Her aunt keeps trying to help around the house and it\u2019s really just pushing me closer to the edge. For instance, last night I was finally getting my son to sleep and she decided it was a great time to make a lot of noise by doing the dishes and taking out the recycling. Just a few minutes ago I almost just started bawling because I found her doing laundry when I asked her four times to leave it to me. I need her out of the house but I know my wife will not handle me being alone well, even though I know it\u2019s what\u2019s best for me. She\u2019s terrified that I\u2019ll fall asleep with the baby or have a mental health crisis of my own so she thinks I need someone with me because that\u2019s how she handles things.\n\nBetween my wife\u2019s mental health and her family being here still, I feel so damn lonely. I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve become a family yet as there\u2019s been effectively no intimate time with just the three of us. My wife has also made comments about not feeling connected to baby so I feel like I\u2019m isolated from her further because I so am. I miss my wife and want her to be here with me and my son. I want to give him baths together and go for walks without someone yelling \u201cdon\u2019t forget a hat!\u201d from the other room. And while all of this is happening, I need to keep it bottled up so I can be my wife\u2019s rock and let her focus on herself. I don\u2019t know man.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Expectations vs Outcome.\n\nI have been wanting to write this post for a while, for the new(er) dads.  I say it that way, as being almost 2 years in, I am still a new dad myself.\n\nYour past will affect the parent you are now.  I had a rough childhood growing up.  I grew up with yelling and anger being normal.  Mom didn't like something, she yelled, and spanked.  I lived in constant fear.  I was terrified of what kind of father I would be.  \n\nWhen my son was born, he would not go to sleep for myself or my wife some nights.  I would get so absolutely frustrated.  I read Dr. Harvey Karp's book \"Happiest Baby on the Block\" and honestly, even with my son being almost 2, it comes in handy.  The tricks to burp my child and get him to sleep really did help, however, sometimes, on those nights where he would not go to sleep, I would get so angry and frustrated.\n\nI felt so terrible and so guilty for how I felt.  I wanted to set a better example than I had.  My wife and I argued a lot in those early months.  We (me more than her) both had expectations of how things were going to go.  I would be rocking and gently bobbing my son to sleep, and he would keep screaming and screaming, and anger and frustration would well up inside me.  I was so angry at him.  Why couldn't he just go to sleep?  I would bob him harder, and harder, and catch myself and stop.  I understood that I was not angry with him.  He is only a few days/weeks/months old, he has no clue what he doing.  Compared to his previous home, it is cold, loud, and bright.  He can't tell me what he wants, what he needs, that he doesn't like how I am holding him.\n\nI've seen many posts in the nearly two years I have been in this group (I mostly lurk) with dads posting similar stories, sometimes they did actually shake, sometimes they had violent thoughts enter their head.  And for the father who gets angry and frustrated with their new child, but can understand that they do feel this way, and can have the control to stop and either put the child down, or hand them off to mom or another family member, you are doing great, you are a good father.  As that child grows, your patience will be challenged.  It is not the child trying to make you angry, but rather, it is them trying to figure out their way in this world.\n\nI have come a long way in the 18 months since I used to get frustrated.  By simply telling myself over and over again that my son is simply trying to understand this world, I have found a level of patience and understanding that I have never had before.  It has made a positive impact on every aspect of my life.  I have held true to my promise to my self to never yell at my son, and I tell you, sometimes, he gets into bad situations.  He will just look at me, smirk, and do something he's not supposed to, but I actually think it's hilarious.  I hold my laughter and put on my \"dad\" face and voice and redirect him, even if I have to pick him up and remove him from the situation, never raising my voice.\n\n  \nSorry, this turned into sort of a rant, but I want the dads who are new and who feel like they are struggling to know, you are not alone.  I cannot say parenting gets easier, but you do start to get the hang of it after a while.  If you are second guessing yourself, that usually means that you are genuinely trying your best.\n\nR\u00e9ponse du papa :", "completion": "Ty for sharing OP.

My wife(37) and I(36) were going to the store to look at fire pits for a 4th of July sale, when my wife noticed she started gushing down there.

We rushed  to the hospital got her in and after about an hour the doctor told us that she had an abruption. This is when the placenta starts separation from the uterus wall. Hence the blood, like a lot of it. Think The Shining. Obviously I was freaking out and worried about mom and baby. Once the abruption got to 30 percent the doctor came in and said we needed to deliver the baby today my wifes words were \"you're shitting me\".

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Turning a corner\n\n5 weeks this week since the birth of my son and I feel like maybe we've finally turned a corner. Breastfeeding has been impossible due to, well, we thought a lactation would tell us, but she didnt. We thought cutting the tongue tie would fix it but it didn't. We thought practice, patience and technique would fix it, but it didn't. He also wasnt sleeping through the day, requiring constant soothing, various other problems that in the grand scheme of things were really, really minor, but in the moment they really, really take a toll.\n\nLooking after the baby isn't too hard in and of itself, what's hard is doing it whilst still doing other things: eating, sleeping, resting, cooking, cleaning, working, taking care of another child, spending time together as a couple, spending time alone, exercising, reading, talking to other adults. It's been hard, and taxing, and frustrating. As a couple we've handled it as well as we can, with moments of tension but a united front. It's still hard. We've had help from family and it's still hard. We've done it before, and it's still hard. We have time, and money (not lots but enough!) and it's still hard. We have so much information and access to professionals and it's still hard. \n\nI've felt bad for finding it hard. We've had no serious health issues. He doesn't even scream, he just fusses a lot. He sleeps well at night, as well as a baby can. I work from home. Our older daughter is amazing. I do not know how people do what they do, given how hard I've found it even though it's been close to perfect. But damn, it's still hard. Emotionally, physically, mentally. \n\nBut it feels like this week things got a little easier. He's sleeping better, so we are.  He's eating better, so we are. He's sturdier, he's more aware. Maybe he's even smiling a little, or maybe it's gas but who cares. \n\nEveryone said it gets easier, and there were dark nights that it felt like terrible platitudes that meant nothing and did nothing to alleviate the stress. They felt like false promises. Like when someone says the water isn't that cold in the pool. It's useless advice that's totally accurate. It hurts to begin with and then you adjust and even if you're still a little cold in the pool, you're ultimately glad you got in. You feel like standing on the side would have been more comfortable, for sure, but that's not why you came. You came to do things, and by god is having a child doing something. It's not for everyone, and nobody should feel bad for not wanting to get in the pool, or have a child. And for sure there's some rationalisation going on when you say \"oh but it's all worth it when the baby says daddy.\" \n\nBut, like the expression about the safest place for a boat being the harbour, I'm learning in real time that the easy life I was creating, the time, the peace, the calm, the financial freedom....there's time for that later. Maybe. I don't know for sure, but the thing is, I'm here now. And they were right. It does get easier and the water does feel warmer.\n\nMaybe that's because it's piss running down my arm, but it is definitely warmer.....\n\nHang tough, dads.\n\nR\u00e9ponse du papa :", "completion": "We were told by two paediatricians and a midwife that he did not have a tongue tie and that his latch was ok, but it hurt like hell for him to feed.

We're two weeks on from the tongue tie now and he's getting better but still not great. I had heard they can regrow, his doesn't seem to be regrowing.\n\nWe're 90% bottle feeding still, trying to increase amount of breast but it's been such a hard time and requires so much stress I'm unsure if it's worth it if he doesn't improve. \n\nBottle feeding is nice because I can help my wife, especially at night, and you can be a bit more structured with it, but we'd like to be able to get him to breast feed."}

It was maybe 5-10 minutes but it felt like a lifetime. After this I carried him to the car so my wife could take him to daycare. Told him I loved him and gave him a big kiss. After they pulled off I went into my office and was paralyzed with anxiety and emotions and just couldn\u2019t stop crying and began to hyperventilate a bit. I am tired. So tired. I gathered myself enough to call the Veteran\u2019s Crisis line because while the demons were loud, his voice was louder. He doesn\u2019t know what that hug this morning did, but I will continue to fight for him! I can\u2019t leave him!

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Update: My baby is dying\n\ntldr for those who can't handle any suspense >!she didn't die!<\n\nHi daddit\n\nI [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1dosga5/my_baby_is_dying/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) a month or so ago about my beautiful baby. The tldr is that she was suffering mysterious seizures. An MRI revealed she had suffered a massive brain bleed and would not survive without a lifetime of medical intervention. \n\nWe opted to remove her breathing support. We  were fully prepared for her to die in our arms. We had heard from the neonatologist that she might die in five minutes or two hours. She wouldn\u2019t last the night. \n\nWe sat our 3.5 year old down to explain it. Baby sister was sick. She was dying. She would not come home with us. I barely got through those sentences. \n\nWe had family visit. We lit a candle. We said our goodbyes. We listened to beautiful music, had a wonderful photographer come by, and waited. A few times our daughter had apnea spells of several minutes. She\u2019d stop breathing and as the Cat Stevens wound down, we\u2019d wait and start crying and, like clockwork, she\u2019d take a big breath, not ready to die. We practiced unsafe sleep the entire night cuddling her and when we woke up, she was still with us. Completely asleep but still alive. \n\nWe spoke with a local children\u2019s hospice and were admitted immediately. One of the transfer paramedics excused himself as we were loading her up. He came back from the bathroom having obviously been in there crying. \n\nIn hospice, the prognosis changed from the initial five minutes/two hours to more like a month, tops. Even an unfed baby can last a surprisingly long time. And what we talked about was \u201cremoving interventions\u201d. No breathing tube, no food being injected into her. We\u2019d feed her for comfort and that\u2019s it. No one expected her to last long. She\u2019d have a few nights with her long apnea spells, but she didn\u2019t die. We explained to our older kid again: baby sister was sick. She was dying. She would not come home with us. \n\nWe treasured every minute like it might be the last. We didn\u2019t put her down for days. She was always in our arms. \n\nWe had therapy, we went on outings, and we played with other very sick children. It was lovely. They helped us figure out benefits and programs and such. They phoned around to local cemeteries so we could figure out a memorial (DYK: many have a baby section and don\u2019t charge you to use these services?). We figured to deal with this admin before the inevitable and we were fucking wrecks. We imagined the memorial, what we\u2019d ask our friends to give in lieu of gifts, where we\u2019d have it. All that. \n\nSo we fed her for comfort. They\u2019d give us a little syringe full of formula \u2014 1 or 5 mls \u2014 and we\u2019d give it to her. We\u2019d wipe the inside of her mouth with a sponge every now and then as her mouth was always dry. \n\nAnd. \n\nThis fucking kid, guys. My fucking baby. You wouldn\u2019t believe it. \n\nSoon, she was taking more and more food. The syringes were gone, out came the bottles. She was alert. Dads, I heard her beautiful voice and her beautiful cry! It was the sweetest and most beautiful sound I\u2019ve ever heard. I saw her eyes again. She looked at me and I looked at her. \n\nShe kept eating. Staff were confused. Doctors said it didn\u2019t change the path we were on, but to treasure that time. \n\nBut instead she thrived. No one knows how or why but, fuck it, she didn\u2019t die. \n\nShe\u2019s eating a lot now. She\u2019s pooping and crying and soiling diapers and doing tummy time and stretching and making all those weird and silly sounds that newborns make. Three separate doctors have all said some variation of, \u201cif I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d say this is a perfectly healthy baby.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m at a loss for words, dads. This is the closest thing to a miracle I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. \n\nWe\u2019ve left hospice. The prognosis is uncertain. The doctor there thinks if she survives for a year \u2014 and she probably will \u2014 he can make a better judgement at how she\u2019ll fare then.\n\nBaby sister is sick. She is dying. But she came home with us. She\u2019s on the changing table I made, she sleeps in her older sister\u2019s old bassinet, she wears the silly clothes we bought her. All the baby shit we thought we\u2019d throw out in our trauma is hers now. She\u2019s in our home. She's doing baby shit. She's rocking tummy time, she's getting plump and fat. It\u2019s the happiest I\u2019ve ever been. \n\nShe almost certainly has brain damage that we\u2019ve yet to identify. We have a follow-up with neurology and tests and all that other shit. She\u2019s on anti-seizure medicine. We\u2019re set up with an incredible paediatrician (our daughters old one who happens to be a fucking all-star neonatologist), we\u2019re ready to do the occupational and physical therapy, we\u2019re set. \n\nBut there\u2019s still grief. \n\nWhen she was admitted to NICU, we grieved the small stupid shit. Dad pulling the car up, helping his wife and his daughter into the car. Early in NICU we learned she might be somewhat disabled. Then they determined she\u2019d die immediately. Then she\u2019d die in weeks or months. Now no one knows. It\u2019s like getting hit by a car every fucking few days. Yeah I\u2019m glad she\u2019s here, I love her so fucking much. But grief is about what you\u2019ve lost. Sometimes it\u2019s a person, sometimes it\u2019s your reality. \n\nWe had silly plans. When she was due to die any time, we were going to hit the gym, hard. We were going to use the grieving period to become absolutely fucking jacked. It was a great plan! I bought a fucking guitar so I could learn that (I\u2019m still determined but free time is at an even greater premium.) We got books on grief for ourselves and our kid and read them for a death that didn\u2019t come. We learned how to deal with death and her death. We planned on being a little sad for all of our lives. To never forget our little baby. For our big kid to always be a big sister, no matter what happened. \n\nBut now we don\u2019t fucking know. It\u2019s terrifying. And yeah we can still hit the gym and I'm still practicing guitar. Just with a newborn around. \n\nShe might be wheelchair-bound. It might be worse. She might be \u2014 and pardon the frank and maybe impolite language \u2014 a vegetable. And that\u2019s obviously a concern. That\u2019s a life of who knows what. \n\nWhat do we do? Can someone tell me it\u2019s going to be okay? How do you cope with something like this? Not just the unknown, but what we might actually be looking at\u2014 that is, profound disability?\n\nAre there any books you\u2019d recommend for this? For me, my wife, or my daughter?\n\n\nPost-script:\n\nThe nurses and doctors who work in NICU and hospice are fucking angels. We had a NICU baby in 2020 and they were simply the best and it\u2019s been no different here. They\u2019re above and beyond the best people in existence. If angels exist, they\u2019re NICU and children\u2019s hospice nurses. \n\nAlso, thanks again to anyone who read my last post and this one.

Annoying but whatever. Then, they were strong enough to jolt me out of twilight sleep as I tried to sleep. Then they were past the point of just discomfort, but, and I want to make this very clear, they were *not* painful. Then, they were time-able. I will not post my timing or exact pain here because if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re basing your decision right now on comparison and the hope that someone else went through your exact current scenario. You can\u2019t do that; I\u2019m so, so sorry I wish it was that easy. No one will have had your *exact* scenario right now. \n\nSo, I called my midwife team five times and they I guess forgot about me (a story for another time), so for four hours I did all the things the internet said to do. I drank a ton of water, I lightly walked, I rested with my feet up, I tried to sleep. No change. I researched prodromal labor and saw that it wasn\u2019t abnormal to start this early and so I kept trying to sleep it off, waiting for that higher authority (my midwife) to make the decision for me. Midwives can be wrong. Or \u201cbusy\u201d. \n\nEventually after that four hours, I knew that I had to make the call, I was that higher authority. I was not making a call for myself, but for a tiny baby who literally had no voice. Thinking of it that way made it easier. So, we woke up my 3 year old and off to the hospital we went, a 40 minute drive. It was 2 am. We had no plan for care for our pets. Our 3 year old was scared and confused. Our bags were random crap we had no idea if we needed. Yes, going to the hospital is inconvenient. Please do it anyway. \n\nLong story short, with some gnarly meds, we were able to stop my wonderful baby girl from being born at 30 weeks. I\u2019m still in the hospital and things are uncertain, but if I had held out for that phone call (still mad about it tbh), or if I had kept telling myself that it wasn\u2019t happening to me, that I was overreacting to something normal, if I had taken my husband\u2019s caring but concerned \u201care you really sure about this\u201d face to heart, I\u2019d have had a 30 week old preemie on my kitchen floor with no steroids, antibiotics, magnesium, NICU staff, etc. \n\nI had no risk factors.

The nurse came in and started a non stress test. Within 5 minutes they had rushed in 4 nurses and one doctor and advised me to quickly get up on my hands and knees on the bed. One nurse trying to find the heartbeat on a Doppler, one with the non stress test, another attempting to put an IV in to rush me back for an emergency csection because THEY COULDNT FIND THE HEART BEAT. The anesthesiologist stood outside waiting. This was easily the most traumatic experience of my life. Finally they found the heartbeat but said it was dangerously low and they needed to take me back for a csection. \n\nWe weren\u2019t even at the hospital for more than 15 minutes before they took me in for a \u201crushed\u201d cesarean. PLEASE ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS trust your gut. Labor and pregnancy symptoms are not a one size fits all. I likely would have lost my baby if I had followed their recommendations. But continuously leaking \u201cdischarge\u201d and having extremely painful \u201cBraxton hicks\u201d contractions did not seem normal to me."}
{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Fell down the stairs at my OBGYN's office, broke my ankle and went into labor.\n\nYesterday morning I had my 36 week appointment with my OBGYN. My OBYN said that everything was going well and assured me I should have a smooth delivery. I was huge but otherwise feeling great.\n\n Then it happened. I was walking down the stairs after my appointment, missed about 2 steps and fell hard and awkwardly onto my leg. I was laying at the bottom of the stairs in excruciating pain and knew instantly that I had broken my ankle/leg. I tried to crawl and get up but couldn't. I can't describe it but I was both panicked and calm at the same time. I tried several more times to get up but couldn't move. I pulled my phone out and called my OBGYN's office. \"Hi, this is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. I just had an appointment with Dr. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and I just fell down the stairs and I think I broke my leg.\" The receptionist stayed on the phone with me until my OBGYN and several other doctors and nurses got to me. She kept asking me questions and I told her I was going to get sick and my stomach was cramping really bad.\n\nMy OBGYN and several other doctors and nurses rushed to me with a wheelchair. They quickly realized that they weren't going to be able to get me into the wheelchair. I was going into shock and honestly didn't realize that I was going into labor until I overheard my OBGYN order one of the nurses to get me a stretcher and get more help because I was going into labor. Everyone tried to keep me calm and comfortable, but the contractions were coming very quick. I threw up at one point. There was also no way I was going to be able to get transferred to the stretcher and into a room either. I suddenly realized that I was going to give birth right there. \n\n  \nThey blocked off the stairwell. Needless to say, I was in excruciating pain. Someone propped up my ankle on some pillows and stabilized it in an aircast boot while my OBGYN ordered someone to call my husband. They told him to get here ASAP. I got some heavy duty pain meds in an IV and my vitals were being monitored. Within an hour and a half, my husband made it and our baby girl was born. What a whirlwind. That was an experience that I will never forget, but I am so happy to have a healthy baby. Baby and I are still in the hospital. I need to follow up with an orthopedist on Monday to see if my broken ankle will just require a cast or if I will also need surgery.\n\n It's going to be an interesting 6-10 weeks being on crutches and taking care of a newborn, to say the least. Any advice would be much appreciated!

One, limit the distances you need to travel to take care of your needs and the baby\u2019s. I set up my station on the couch and had all the necessities within reach: massive water bottle, bassinet, snacks, pumping stuff/bottles, pillows, diapers, diaper pail, hand sanitizer, baby clothes, Tylenol etc. Obviously, you\u2019ll need to restock at least a couple times a day and get up to use the bathroom and tend to the occasional really messy baby situation, but better not to do too much. Two, carrying newborns is terrifying and so much more so\u00a0if you\u2019re not stable yourself. Have a rolling crib/bassinet/stroller near by to move them around if you need to. Third, when you are able to get moving a bit more, standing up while carrying the baby might be more challenging. Have safe places to set them down so you can stand up first. Fourth, it won\u2019t be like this forever so give yourself some grace. Best of luck, you got this!"}
{"prompt": "Post Reddit : My Experience Having a Baby With Clubfoot\n\nHello there! I wanted to share my experience having a baby with clubfoot because I remember desperately searching Reddit for any information after we received the diagnosis to help understand what things would look like. \n\nIn late 2022, during my anatomy ultrasound, I noticed the ultrasound tech spending an extreme amount of time surveying the baby\u2019s legs and feet. It was fairly evident that something wasn\u2019t right based on her reaction, but she let us know the doctor would call us with our results. My heart sank and I started googling and a few hours later had come to the conclusion that it was probably clubfoot. The doctor did not, indeed, call us. Instead, I found out that my son was going to be born with a birth defect through a MyChart notification. I\u2019m still salty about that. \n\nI got very upset and took a day to process before I called my mom and told her. She goes \u201coh, I had that\u201d as if it was no big deal, an afterthought. Here I am in an anxiety spiral and she just brushed off the fact that she forgot to mention this in the 30 years I\u2019ve known her. Later down the line, once I\u2019d calmed down a bit, I appreciated how minuscule a blip it was in her life. It wasn\u2019t something that impacted her as an adult and it hadn\u2019t crossed her mind in decades.\n\nAt my next OB appointment, I was referred to a geneticist and a high risk OB. The geneticists laid out my options to do more extensive testing and we discussed our family history and we opted to do a blood test that they described to be like the NIPT but with more information about potential chromosomal issues. Based on our family history and the ultrasound results, they thought it unlikely that there would be a comorbidity that would be of any concern so we felt good about that. \n\nThe rest of the pregnancy was mostly uneventful. His kicks felt sharper than my previous pregnancy. I grappled with some guilt and worked through it. I found the clubfoot Facebook groups and spent a lot of time reading there so I would know what to expect. That ended up being a bit of a double edged sword because I saw all kind of complications, complaints, and disagreements that probably stressed me out more than what was necessary. \n\nThe delivery was uncomplicated, but there was a constant stream of curious medical personnel for a while, and one nurse very delicately asked me if we had known about the clubfoot or if it was a surprise lol. The first weeks he was like any other newborn, except when he would scrunch his legs up, his feet would pound into his genitals and then he would get upset because it hurt. That was something I hadn\u2019t expected! If we had been planning to circumcise, that would have made me chose to delay the procedure until he had casts on his feet to prevent unnecessary discomfort. \n\nWhen it came time to see an orthopedist (around 2 or 3 weeks? It\u2019s been a while), I looked all around the major metro area we were close to to find a ponsetti specialist, but there were none in the area. If you are a parent reading this, the ponsetti method of treating clubfoot seems to be like the gold standard. In a typical case there are no major surgeries and a low rate of relapse if you follow the method. The closest ponsetti specialist to us ended up being Dr. Dobbs, , who is like the Ponsetti superstar in the south east but who was 4 hours away, so I opted for someone more local. \n\nThe first set of casts my son received looked like lumps. The knee was not bent at all 90 degree angle as I\u2019d read was optimal and I couldn\u2019t really see his toes to know if his casts had slipped. I\u2019ll include pictures, but it didn\u2019t feel right. We still stuck with this doctor and the next week got a second set of casts. When we went back for the third set, my son\u2019s skin was completely raw and irritated and the doctor recommended going without casts for a week. Over night his feet completely returned to their original position at birth and we had completely lost any progress. It was devastating. I reached out to Dr. Dobbs and he emailed me back that night! I described the treatment we\u2019d received and asked if that was typical (to which he answered no) and asked if he knew of any doctors in my area that he would recommend for the treatment (also no). I decided then to make the switch and deal with the long drive and see him as our doctor and that was hands down the best decision I could have made for my son. They were able to see us just a few days later to restart the casting process. Because we were not local, they were able to slightly accelerate the process which meant my son was receiving new casts every four or five days instead of every seven. \n\nDealing with the casts themselves as a parent was not a huge deal. They were heavy and bulky and sometimes made it hard to snuggle up the way I wanted to and required support while breastfeeding. We were still able to do tummy time. I had to roll up a blanket under baby\u2019s knees to keep him comfortable while he slept and he did have a poor quality of sleep at first and following the day or two after each new set of casts. It was a sleepless period for sure, but we made it through. \n\nI would suggest putting leg warmers over the casts. Poo will make its way over there and you can take off and wash the leg warmers. Once it\u2019s on the cast, you\u2019re stuck with it until the next set. It\u2019s not a big deal, but I would definitely recommend bringing leg warmers with you to that first casting appointment. \n\nAfter casting was over (5 or 6 rounds with Dobbs if I remember correctly?) it was time for the tenotomy. This is where the doctor makes a small incision and clips the Achilles tendon to release it. Many doctors do it under anesthesia but Doctor Dobbs and his team were able to do it while baby was awake with just a local sedative which I was grateful for. I was a mess handing him off to the nurse, I felt so bad knowing I was passing him off for him to be put in pain that he wouldn\u2019t understand. A short twenty to thirty minutes later they brought him back to us in the recovery room. He fussed a little but I definitely cried more than he did. For our son, the tenotomy ended up being such a nonevent. He didn\u2019t seem to be in any discomfort and napped most of the drive home. All in all, it was incredibly uneventful. \n\nDuring the tenotomy procedure, they placed him in his final set of casts. By this time we were old pros. The next appointment (a week or two later maybe?) we came back and his casts were removed and he was given a brace called boots and bar. \n \nMoving on to the bracing part of treatment was the BEST. In comparison to the casts, the boots were lightweight and allowed baby to move his knees. We could cuddle more easily and closely. Most importantly, we had four periods of fifteen minutes a piece where we could take the boots and bar off, do stretches, and he was free to move as he pleased. It was heaven getting to give that stinky baby a proper bath! He had a hard time sleeping the first few nights in the boots and bar and we had to cut open the bottom of his sleep sack, but once he adjusted he slept much better overall. \n\nOver the next year, we went from 23 hours of brace wear to 22, to 18, and now he just wears his brace during naps and at night time. We have struggled with the condition of the skin on his feet from time to time. Sometimes his straps will be too tight and leave a welt, we\u2019ve been battling athletes foot and had some success with lotrimin during the day and antiperspirant spray before bed, but overall, his clubfoot is such an afterthought now. I don\u2019t look at him and see the clubfoot, he\u2019s just a kid that sleeps in some funny looking shoes. He will sleep in some manner of brace until he\u2019s four.\n\nHe was a little slow to crawl but started walking at 13 months. Now he runs and climbs! (Send help). \n\nThere\u2019s still a chance he could relapse and we would need to do the casting and tenotomy and bracing again, and I hope that doesn\u2019t happen, but I know if it does that it\u2019s something we can handle. This mountain that felt so gigantic during my pregnancy turned out to be a mole hill. \n\nIf you\u2019re a parent finding this post, even years later, and you have questions for me, please feel free to send me a dm. Know that you can do this! And get leg warmers for the casts!\n\nR\u00e9ponse du papa :", "completion": "This was great to read.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Update: I gave my baby daughter herpes (HSV-1) by kissing the top of her head\n\nI shared my story here about one year ago. I wrote the story in the hospital the morning after our daughter was diagnosed with HSV-1 and while waiting for my wife to wake up. I thought I should share the story again to try to make more people aware so they may be able to avoid a similar or worse situation. Below is the link to the post:\u00a0[https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1724y9l/i\\_gave\\_my\\_baby\\_daughter\\_herpes\\_hsv1\\_by\\_kissing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1724y9l/i_gave_my_baby_daughter_herpes_hsv1_by_kissing/)\n\nTo summarize, I kissed the top of our 6.5 week old baby on the top of her skull while I had a cold sore and it resulted in her being infected with herpes (HSV-1/the cold sore virus). I did not know that infection could occur through regular skin. Growing up I was only taught that it could spread through contact with the mouth or lips, and I only learned about infection being possible to genitals or breasts as an adult. Prior to the kiss, I think I may also have been unaware about the seriousness of infections to babies and was trying to prevent its spread to our children solely based on on the discomfort and embarrassment I endured in my own life as a result of developing cold sores.\n\nOur daughter was provided with IV antiviral treatment for one week in the hospital before we were discharged. We were given a prescription for one week's worth of oral antiviral medication to be taken from home, and had a follow-up appointment with the infectious disease doctor around a week after discharge. Although they were unable to take a sample of spinal fluid to check if HSV had spread to our daughter's central nervous system, they thought that the virus was likely only skin deep in her case. And we were told that we would need to come back to the children's hospital immediately if the sores presented themselves again (I assume at least until she is one or two years old).\n\nOur daughter has had one or two outbreaks of HSV-1 since we initially left the hospital. The first of those outbreaks was around three weeks after leaving the hospital and resulted in a hospital stay overnight followed by about two months of oral antivirals to be provided from home. And the other time was around one month after using up the antivirals from the previous outbreak but the sore went away on its own within 24 hours. We were going to pickup antivirals for the last time but all pharmacies were closed so we decided to wait until the morning, but the sore was almost fully gone by the morning. Both recurrences showed up at the same location as the initial sore and kiss (top of skull).\n\nMy wife met with an infectious disease doctor in February to discuss our daughter's case, and the doctor said that \"\\[our baby\\] got really lucky. There are limited treatment options and \\[our baby's\\] case was very minor compared to most.\"\n\nShe seems to be a very happy and healthy baby. In my opinion, since she was about midway through her stay in the hospital she seemed to be in a happier place and is still there as long as she isn't wanting to be held or nursed by her mom. My wife and I both agree that she has been the happiest of our babies. And we recently celebrated her first birthday.\n\nI have posted this story to a number of different subreddits to try to raise awareness, especially for parents or soon-to-be parents. Many users have expressed gratitude for the posts because they were unaware regarding the dangers of HSV or how infectious it is. So I am glad to have possibly helped prevent some similar or worse cases from occurring. A user also commented not too long ago on an older post of mine suggesting that I \"share it over and over\" because they think the information is valuable, so I thought I should do an update post here to help spread the info some more and give an update to anyone who saw my earlier post.\n\nTL;DR: I gave my baby daughter a single kiss on the top of her head and now she has herpes (HSV-1). But she seems to be doing ok, and I have been trying to help others avoid a similar or worse situation.\n\nR\u00e9ponse du papa :", "completion": "Thanks for sharing your story and for the update.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : I kept having nightmares that my baby was tangling himself in his umbilical cord throughout my pregnancy and it turned out to be true (true knot)\n\nFrom about 12 weeks onwards I kept having regular nightmares that my son was tangling himself up in his umbilical cord and it was hurting him. I mentioned it to literally everyone, it was almost an all consuming fear at one point. My OB told me there was nothing to worry about, the baby looked perfect. I had multiple ultrasounds throughout my pregnancy due to being high risk, and even the ultrasound tech said everything looked fine. I was able to push it out of my mind for the most part but about a week before I was induced I kept seeing dead baby animals literally everywhere I went. I told my husband about it and he said it was just a coincidence and not to think too much into it. \n\nFast forward to 38 weeks. I was induced due to hypertension (not pre-eclampsia related.) After about 24 hours of labor, my son started having decels every time I had a contraction. He also had what the doctors called an \u201cominous heart beat\u201d when he wasn\u2019t deceling, like his heart rate would not go above a certain level even if they were messing with him. This baby had literally kinked his head in the birthing canal to prevent himself from advancing further. The doctors tried twice to manually reposition him (aka putting their entire forearm inside of me to do it.) We ended up rushing for an emergency c-section because the attending just had a bad feeling about it.\n\nThank god for that doctor because my son would have likely been a still born if we hadn\u2019t done the c-section. He had what was called a \u201ctrue knot\u201d, where at some point early in the pregnancy he had moved around so much he had caused a knot in the cord. They said the knot was extremely tight and white. When I told the doctor and nurses about my dream they told me it gave them goose bumps. The OB nurse that took care of us had been a nurse for 25 years and told me having a true knot was extremely rare and that he was the first baby she took care of that had one that wasn\u2019t still born or needed a long NICU stay. \n\nAnyways, I just had to tell someone about this. I am not a very religious person but I do believe something was guiding me and preparing me for the delivery while also protecting my son. He is now a healthy 7 week old and I thank god every day for the awesome OB team I had.\n\nR\u00e9ponse du papa :", "completion": "Leading up to my scheduled c section I was terrified I was going to die, then the day before the c/s I woke up and my worry had changed to, what if something\u2019s wrong with the baby and I worried about it all day.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Everyone tells you about reduced fetal movements but nobody told me about excessive movements\n\nTW: Stillbirth \n\nI was pregnant with twin girls until a few weeks ago and due to the high risk nature of my pregnancy I was seeing a consultant every 2 weeks as well as having an ultrasound every 2 weeks. Let's just say I was at the hospital A LOT. \n\nAt every Dr appointment I was told to come in immediately if I noticed reduced movements. I never noticed reduced movements ever. The girls were generally active and I got to know their schedule pretty well. They liked to party in the mornings and evenings mostly with the rest of the day having less energy but still reassuring me that they were fine. \n\nThe night before my last scan my girls were moving so much that my bump was completely changing shape, lopsided to one side then to the other side, coming up down and every which way. Very vigorous movements that it was painful for me. I figured they were partying and tried to get some sleep. \n\nIn the morning I headed to the hospital for my scheduled scan and the Dr asked how I was and how were the babies' movements. I told her about the party the night before and laid down on the table ready for the scan. Twin B was easier to scan since she was more accessible higher up so the Dr started with her and all was good. Then she moved on to Twin A down into my pelvis and she struggled to find her heartbeat. Sometimes that happens because of her position so at this point I was not concerned. Then Dr starts asking me what time I had breakfast, whether I'd taken my blood thinner injection this morning and whether my husband was working today. That's when I knew something was wrong. She called for another Dr to come and check Twin A, she said he had more experience and would be able to get a better look. When he came to scan he was quiet, and after he checked he quietly spoke to my Dr and left. \n\nThen she told me. Twin A had passed away. I didn't believe her at first. I could still feel movements really low down. She said it was Twin B's movements pushing her sister that I could feel. She said we really need to get Twin B out today and I would have to be prepped for a C-section as soon as possible. She told me to call my husband and arrange childcare for my older kids so he could be with me. \n\nI had to be put to sleep for the surgery because I had taken the blood thinners and also had breakfast so I was at high risk of bleeding out. Twin B was taken straight to NICU and I was not able to see her for 6 hours after she was born. Her dad visited her and I was told she was ok, she needed some help in the beginning but she had stabilised and was doing well. \n\nThe Dr who performed the C-section told me that sometimes whether is a one off instance of excessive movements that can be a sign of distress in a baby and it was very likely she was struggling the night before and we just didn't realise it. I looked it up afterwards because I had never heard of this in any of my 3 pregnancies and it is not very common but a one off incident of excessive fetal movements is one of the indicators of a stillbirth. Everyone always mentions about reduced movements but if I had known about excessive movements then I would have headed to the hospital the night before and maybe I wouldn't have had to bury my child. \n\nI'm putting this here because I think it's important that people know what to look out for. It's not something that's ever talked about but it could be the difference between life and death for a baby. \n\n\nTwin B is doing well btw, still in the NICU but just working on feeding and growing now before she can be discharged.\n\nR\u00e9ponse du papa :", "completion": "I am so incredibly sorry for your loss; what a horrific thing to experience.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : What I wish I knew pre-baby\n\nOur little one (first baby) is three weeks old today and I have been thinking since he was born that I wanted to write a summary of all the preconceptions I got wrong before he arrived / advice I would give to expectant parents, having recently gone through pregnancy and birth. The reality is very different than I expected. Here are my main takeaways:\n\n1. Stop reading negative posts. I read so many negative stories about difficult births and was subscribed to a postpartum depression group during pregnancy, so absorbed a lot of negativity. I did this because I wanted to prepare myself for the worst, if it happened. But in the end I had a very easy birth and the first weeks of his life have been great, with no hormone crash so far. It's been a magical time really. I wish I hadn't scared myself by reading so many negative things before birth. Worrying doesn't change anything. I have been very pleasantly surprised by how easy and lovely the experience has been (I know that's not the case for everyone and I am lucky). \n\n2. Breastfeeding is a minefield and I wish I had been more prepared, even though I took a class in advance. I wasn't knowledgeable about alternatives for when breastfeeding does not work. I stayed in hospital for three days after the birth and we ended up having to kind of beg our hospital for formula at the end of day 2, when my milk had not arrived and baby was clearly hungry. It felt like the hospital which is very pro-breastfeeding did not want to even give us the option of formula initially. And I had not realised that in Belgium where we live, the official advice is to use bottled water for formula, not to heat it, and not to sterilise bottles - ie. It's super easy and we did not need to buy a bunch of stuff we thought we did. I soldiered on with pumping regularly and that's had some results but I also wish I practised at my leisure with using an electric pump before birth to harvest colostrum, rather than learning in a stressed out way once baby was earthside.\n\n3. Speaking of buying stuff... we have loved having a dedicated changing table, would recommend getting one, even though I read mixed opinions on this before he arrived. And a spare bed in the nursery has been great, so that me and his dad can do 4 hour shifts at night, to ensure we both get a minimum amount of sleep. One thing we have way too much of is baby clothes. Between gifts and donations the baby has a bigger wardrobe than I do and I pray nobody gives us any more clothes for him. Baby clothes can be bought for practically nothing second hand so don't buy new stuff!\n\n4. The sleep deprivation is a bit tougher than expected even as an experienced insomniac. We have had some early luck with bubba by encouraging longer wake windows during the day but it's too early to tell really. I also miss going to bed with my husband, but accept it is a necessary solution for now and won't last forever. \n\n5. The first trimester was by far the worst for me in terms of fatigue and nausea and it really rattled me. I was a zombie for 3 months. Have faith that it will get better! The second and third trimesters were not easy exactly but totally manageable. \n\n6. Finally, weight gain. I put on about 60 pounds in total, about half of this in the first trimester. I found this so, so psychologically hard given that all the advice says you shouldn't gain anything in the first tri, and many women actually lose weight in this period due to morning sickness. But I learned that this is totally unique to each person. As the pregnancy progressed my weight gain slowed, and I also stopped caring, marvelling instead at what my body was capable of doing. I wish I hadn't stressed so much about weight gain. Half is already gone in the first three weeks post partum and the decrease in my hunger levels now is really noticeable. This is one subject I would encourage new moms to read posts about as overwhelming most women seem to have the same advice.\n\nGood luck expectant parents! There are wonderful things coming :)\n\nR\u00e9ponse du papa :", "completion": "I am 17 weeks pregnant and your post has given me so much hope!\n\nI, too, have a tendency to read a lot of negative pregnancy stuff online. I made myself sick while waiting for my genetics test because of all the scary stuff that I read on the topic. The test thankfully came back low risk and baby boy has been perfect at every ultrasound, but I regret all the sleepless nights and extra worrying that I made myself go through.\n\nIn retrospect, my pregnancy has been amazing and I was fortunate to not have an awful first trimester. However, I, too, have gained quite a bit of weight. I\u2019m only 17 weeks along and already gained 20 pounds and I can\u2019t help but feel like I am doing something wrong because most women don\u2019t gain as much or at all during the first semester. Thanks for highlighting your weight experience; it honestly makes me feel normal.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : The BEST advice I\u2019ve received when becoming a new Mom\n\nI recently asked a very thoughtful, insightful friend who has 3 children if she wouldn\u2019t mind sharing any general parenting advice as I am pregnant with my first. I thought her advice was WONDERFUL and not like anything I had heard before, so I wanted to share\u2026 \n\n\u201cThe biggest piece of advice I have after 7 years of parenting is WAIT to get advice until you know what your struggles are. Children are so unique. Moms are so unique. There\u2019s not a whole lot of value in getting a ton of advice on nursing if it turns out your boobs are champs and your baby is a rockstar nurser, you know? Then again maybe your boobs are great but your baby struggles to latch-- then that\u2019s what you seek advice for. I have found that it\u2019s like that no matter what stage you\u2019re at-- the VAST majority is only helpful if it\u2019s **relevant** for you and your little gal! As my kids have gotten older I\u2019ve observed that some kids are simply more mild and easy going than others. Part of that is their genes, part of it is their personality, part of it is their birth order, part of that comes from whether they are neurotypical or neurodiverse... So, my advise is to really try and understand what\u2019s going on with you and your daughter and THEN go to the support groups and the individuals and the experts that you know have tackled yours or a similar issue!\u201d\n\nR\u00e9ponse du papa :", "completion": "Let your spouse make mistakes to learn even if it makes life temporarily harder."}

Fetal macrosomia, especially at extremes (most providers say 11lbs and above) can increase risk of severe complications like shoulder dystocia. When babies reach a certain estimated size, the risk of these severe complications greatly increases. Is a risk a guarantee that it\u2019ll happen? No, but as with anything, each individual needs to do their own risk assessment and decide how much risk they are willing to accept. However, childbirth is still a leading global cause of death in women, particularly in low resourced areas that do not have access to appropriate medical interventions. Managing risk is essential to a safe delivery.\n\n\nIf you really want a vaginal birth and know you might end up with an emergency c-section, that\u2019s fine! But listen to your medical providers about the risks and options. Their job is to literally KEEP YOU AND BABY SAFE AND ALIVE. They are not recommending an induction or c-section because they have plans, they are recommending it because they believe the outcome will be better for you and your LO.

After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you\u2019ll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out.

It can be just about anything\u2026and the wave comes crashing.

You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Update: Mom in law throwing herself a Grandma shower\n\nHey Everybody who remembers me posting about how my mom in law stopped helping with my baby shower because she was planning her own \u201cGrandma shower\u201d and didn\u2019t want to invite her friends or family to the actual baby shower because she already planned one for herself. The comments from everyone made me feel less crazy for thinking this is a ridiculous idea. Also the advice I received from you all was really helpful. We ended up having our shower at my parents house an hour away and were able to invite some old aunts. The shower turned out great and I was actually surprised that 3 of my aunts came. Also I did like you guys said and invited my mom in laws friends that were important to my husband even though my mom in law told us not to, making them realize there was actually a baby shower happening. Guess what?!? They all came and supported us and were even willing to drive over an hour to get there! One of her friends even posted on Facebook all the photos from the shower about how much fun she had! And another one of mother in laws friends commented that we didn\u2019t get to invite \u201coh no did I miss the baby shower?\u201d and my mom in law comments \u201cno you didn\u2019t my grandma shower is next weekend\u201d proving the point that her friends have no idea the mom to be isn\u2019t going to be there at the grandma shower. Apparently she has her grandma shower next weekend so we will see how that turns out \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n\n***Update So mom- in law didn\u2019t post a bunch of Facebook pictures yet of \u201cgrandma shower\u201d which is interesting because she posts pictures of everything! I have many mutual friends on Facebook and was sure to post our photos of our baby shower so any mutual friends know it already happened. I did see that one of the friends who she told us not to invite to our baby shower because she would have to choose between her grandma shower and ours was actually out of state this weekend.  Looks like she didn\u2019t go to grandma shower after all because she went to ours. I\u2019m obviously not close with mom in law to ask her how it went so if there\u2019s anything interesting I\u2019ll let you guys know. \n\n***Update #2 \nMom in laws friend posted a tik tok she made of MILs baby shower. It looks like it was at a friend\u2019s house and there were maybe 10 people there. I\u2019ve met like 5 of them a few times, so I don\u2019t think it would have been abnormal for them to have been invited to the actual baby shower but \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. MIL didn\u2019t give us those friend\u2019s contacts because she wanted them to come to her shower and not have to choose but obviously they are her friends. Tik tok features Photo of her being the center of attention with gifts surrounding her. Her friend commented  \u201cIt was an honor to co- host with ___ and____.  It\u2019s a beautiful thing to walk with your friends, hand in hand, through the wonderful stages of our lives. Becoming a grandma is one of those. And because it\u2019s a grandma shower, we had a mimosa bar!

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : UPDATE: Friend won't be induced until 43 weeks\n\nLots of folks wanted an update so here's the latest! Here is the previous post for reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/s/bPP85QAZDx \n\nMy friend said her water was starting to leak on Thursday around 2pm. She said her doctor told her not to come in until her contractions are 4 min apart. She was not currently having contractions but more sharp cramps. Friday morning, I checked in on her. She said she's still not having contractions and she still plans to go in that night (last night) around 8pm. I text her around that time to wish her luck and I hope things go well, yadda yadda. She just said \"thank you\" and nothing else. No updates overnight.\n\nMy friend is a nurse at her delivery hospital and called me this morning, asking for an update because she's concerned about her water breaking nearly 48 hours ago and she hasn't had the baby. So, she called her hospital to see if my friend was there and they have no record of her checking in at all. She plans to text her this morning and see if she says she is in the hospital or what. We are all in the same group chat, for reference.\n\nThis is all just so crazy. My nurse friend said there's no way her doctor wouldn't have her immediately come in if she's 43 weeks and her water broke. I have no idea what to think. This friend is always really open and texts us all the time with random updates so the radio silence is not normal for her.\n\nUpdate: friend says she's currently at the hospital and doing well but it's possible she put herself on the privacy list. \n\n{Edited to remove private information}\n\n**I get it. Nurse friend may crossed a line. I have no idea. Just updating with what I was told. \n\nTo be continued! \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nUpdate 2: it's now been almost 48 hours since she's arrived at the hospital, supposedly. She has said multiple times that she's there and all is well. Zero pictures, updates, or information. She's responding to other messages like normal. It's been 72 hours (I think) since her water broke and she's past 43 weeks now. This friend is one who sends tons of pictures when she's doing anything exciting so... This is definitely not like her. She has volunteered pregnancy related information the last several months. \n\nWe don't know how long to let this go. We all agree that we think there is no pregnancy or baby. We've all been friends since elementary school so this is hard for us to accept. There's 3 options. 1) she's pregnant and lied about her due date for whatever reason. 2) she truly believes she's pregnant even though we are pretty sure she hasn't been a doctor. 3) she's just straight up lying. This is hard for us because she hasn't posted on social media so if she wanted the attention, why not post there too? We are thinking that she's lied about previous life events. She was once engaged for years without any wedding or meeting the supposed fiance. I'm sad for her and mad/disappointed she is lying to us. \n\nWhat do we do??\n\nUpdate 3: I don't even know how to start. Friend has supposedely been in the hospital for several days at this point. I'm actually in St Lucia right now on vacation so don't have access to our chat group via texts so trying to get updates via FB.\n\nOne friend in that text group said she reached out privately and the friend said she had the baby but was too stressed to send pics or updates. So she reached out to the other friend in the chat who said she also reached out to the pregnant friend who said she has NOT had the baby and was starting pitocin that day. So she's now telling people different things \n\nAnd now, another reddit user reached out via PM. She posted a topic on the Pregnancy subreddit about this exact story. Someone linked her to my posts. I can confirm it is indeed the same person. The main details she has shared are the same with a few things that are off from what I was told. \n\nWe are actively trying to get a hold of her parents. They moved recently and no longer have the landline number but we are very concerned.\n\nEdit 4: one friend in our group was able to find pregnant friends home address. This friend is closest to her between all of us. She is going to go over this evening and is prepared to talk to her. We talked to someone we know who is a psychologist and helped us with what to say, how she might react, etc. her parents should be there as well.\n\nPregnant friend has told one friend that she had the baby yesterday and another friend that she just had the baby an hour ago and is being discharged, which is just impossible. We think she truly believes she is pregnant based off a pregnancy test and it was likely a chemical pregnancy. She never met with a doctor because other tests were negative and I think deep down, she was afraid a doctor would confirm that there is no baby. So, she decided to carry on as if she was pregnant and now she has tricked herself into thinking she is pregnant.\n\nWe also found the baby daddy from Europe. He is married. We believe maybe they had an affair. His wife may have already tried talking to pregnant friend and accused her of lying. Or, maybe she found some random guy and made the whole thing up. We have no idea. We are going to urge her to go to a mental health facility in her town.\n\nR\u00e9ponse du papa :", "completion": "Dude! I had a life long friend do this to me in 2022.

Her mom was so embarrassed but also worried. Friend ended up going to inpatient psych for a few days. She\u2019s a pathological liar.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Going to hospital and need to tell mom\n\nThis is going to be a long post. Sorry for any TMI I'm 18 and 28 weeks pregnant. I haven't told anyone I'm pregnant. I got pregnant at a party where I lost my viriginity to some guy. I was drunk and don't remember it at all. I ahve felt shame ever since. I was set on getting an abortion but in my state parental consent and notification were a thing, as I was still 17. I didn't want this baby. So I kept it inside until I turn 18 at 11 weeks pregnant, before I finally seen a doctor. I've wanted to tell my mom, but I didnn't know how. I didn't want to tell her a bout what happened at the party I wasn't even allowed to go too because I was grounded. So I lied. Then I've been up and down on what to do about the baby. I feel sick. I feel no connection but shame and regret. But the last few weeks I've been starting to think about waht if I can't put her up for adoption. Two weeks ago I had my fourth prenatal appointment. My blood pressure was a bit elevated at 145/92. They tested my urine for protein and negative. I've been monitoring my blood pressure and it's been fluctuating around 135/80 to 140/95. Today it went up to 155/95, along with a really bad migraine, fatigue and nausea. I called the doctor and he told me to go to the ER. It's been three hours, when I took my blood pressure again and it was 160/100 so I called my mom at work to come home because I was really sick and need to go to the hospital. I know I need to tell her the truth. How do I tell her the truth? Why didn't I tell her? I'm not feeling well. I'm worried about the baby. Me? I don't know what to do. She'll be home in about twenty minutes. Baby still moving as normal. I'm not sure what to do. I'm freaking out.\n\nUpdate: I'm seriously overwhelmed from all the responses. I honestly thought no one would care and judge me for being stupid. I'm in the hospital. Even after my mom came  home, it took until we were pulling up to the hospital to tell her. I was seriously so close to throwing up. I was shaking, saying I feel like I was going to pass out over and over again. It's when we were going into the ER when I just started crying and saying I was pregnant. It just all came out at once. She just kept telling me everything was going to be all right over and over again. My blood pressure was 172/101 so I was sent up to labor and delivery pretty much immedietly after I admitted I was 28 weeks. That shocked my mom. But then in the room, it happened so fast. I got hooked up to fetal monitoring, then they took blood. Then there was fifteen minutes of my mom and I. I felt so bad for not telling her, but I told her what happened at the party, and how I didn't remember, and felt ashamed, and scared. That I had intially planned on abortion, then adoption. Then now I wasn't sure what I wanted. I knew she was dealing with a lot of shit after my dad just left her for another woman last year, then this shit happened and I've been dealing with it. It just had been a lot.  She just hugged me, and we both kind of cried. Blood work came back. Some elevated levels, I can't really remember what right now. My mind is a million miles an hour. BUt they gave me something to help with stablizing my blood pressure, gave me a steroid shot for baby. As of ten minutes ago blood pressure is 135/95. In two hours they are going to check my urine and blood again. My mom is going to go home to find somewhere for my sister tos tay tonight and grab some stuff and come back. I'm going to try and sleep now that I'm feeling a little bit more myself. I had intended for this to be a short update but I guess I just needed to unpack everything. Thanks everyone who have reached out. I'd reply individually if I wasn't so exhausted.\n\n2nd Update: I didn't think posting about my experience to a bunch of strangers would actually make me feel better or I would have made an account when I first found out. Last night and overnight was a bit rough. My blood pressure kept going up and down. It went up to 160/105 I believe, but quickly came down with more fluids. I got diagnosed with pre eclampsia with moderate to severe effects. They did up the blood pressure medication, at in a few hours will give me a second steroid shot. It really honestly sounds like I'll be here until she is here. They are hoping to get me to 32 weeks but based on my lab results and urine results they suspect it could be as early as this weekend. I have been feeling more or less pretty tired, nausea and this headache that seems to be up and down. My mom has been good. I know she feels really sad I kept it from her and that I suffered alone. She wanted to call my dad to let him know what was going on, and I got really upset at that. I really don't want to talk to him, let him know anything, because frankly most of the time I don't even think of him and treat him how he treated his family when he left to make a new one. I know how I reacted to her suggesting  it brought some old wounds up and I feel bad all over again. I'm honestly still feeling overwhelmed, surreal and not sure what the hell the next week, never mind few months are looking like. Just hoping to make it a few more weeks, because apremature baby that I'm not even sure what to do with, is daunting enough.  Thanks everyone.\n\n3rd Update: Thanks for all the support. This will be quick. I haven't been feeling well. My blood pressure has been spiking and not coming down. Protein in urine, and blood work isn't great. Ultrasound is showing some problem with the placenta. I'm having the baby tonight. I'm exhausted. I'm terrified. This all feels overwhelmingly surreal.\n\n4th Update: She was born at 7:23pm last night. I was originally scheduled for an induction, but it turned quickly into an emergency c-section. I'll post more later.\n\n5th Update: This whole delivery and pregnancy has truly traumatized me. My blood pressure got up to 201/115 during the induction, and I got put under. I woke up with double vision, nausea, and just the worst sickness I've ever experienced. It took me until today to be able to muster the courage to see the baby. I am really struggling, emotionally. My mom has been handling this really well for someone who was kept in the dark. I can tell she is allready growing attached to the baby. She won't in so many words, but I know she wants me to keep the baby. I think I need a few more days, to really unpack what had happened this last week. But baby was offically born June 9th at 7:23pm 28 weeks 6 days, 2 pounds 2 oz.\n\n6th Update: July 19/2024: It's been a while since I've updated. The first few weeks were really hard. I had a hard time connecting with the baby. I had to be readmitted two days after I was finally discharged becasue of elevated blood pressure and five days later released again, on blood pressure  medication which I'm still on. I didn't want to hold her. I found it hard to pump milk, and/or visit. It wasn't until she was almost 32 weeks and over three pounds where I started to come around. I started to visit out of want versus obligation. That sound really bad, but just the whole experience had been really hard. Now that she is 34w3d, 4lb 3oz, on the lowest setting on the CPAP. She hasn't got the concept of sucking from a bottle, but is taking in 22ml every 3 hours of breast milk fortified with something to give baby extra calories. All in all there hadn't been  many serious complications and accordingto staff her stay has been uneventful for the most part. For me the whole thing is and still continues to be traumatic. I did start up on antidepressents because it was clear as day I have PDD. It has helped a lot with feeling less overwhelmed and making bonding a lot easier. Things with my mom are good, and she has been supportive. I've reached out to my dad after I had time to process everything. He has came to see the baby once, but more or less things are tense and I'm not going to put  too much effort into staying connected at this time.\n\nR\u00e9ponse du papa :", "completion": "I don\u2019t have the answer but am really impressed with your diligence and ability to maintain your appointments and check your BP despite struggling with feelings of attachment.

(They have made it VERY CLEAR that they HAVE to be there, my MIL even demanded she be in the room while I push.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : I promise you they won't miss sleepovers\n\nSince I encountered multiple episodes of inappropriate behavior and/or blatant sexual assault by men during sleepovers as a child, we've had a firm \"no sleepovers\" rule. People sometimes balk at this because the idea makes it seem like the kids are missing out. They totally aren't. Today, my daughter celebrated her 11th birthday with a drop-off pajama party from 3p to 8p featuring a cotton candy machine, Taylor swift karaoke, chocolate fountain,facepainting, hair painting, hide and seek, a step and repeat for posing for pictures, each kid signed her wall with a paint marker because her room is her space, we opened gifts and played with them from the start of the party, and we all made friendship bracelets while watching Elf. I spent very little to do the party since I made the cake and did the activities myself. If you're at all worried you'll get whining when you reject requests for sleepovers, just host epic pajama parties and you'll be the talk of the town. After a few years of doing these parties, my kids classmates clamor to get invites. This year, that meant 18 kids joined us. It was loud.\n\nR\u00e9ponse du papa :", "completion": "It seems like there would be a statistical difference in risk between a slumber party and a sleepover.\n\nA slumber party has multiple guests who are together in a group. This may bring out risky group behavior depending on the kids, ages, and group dynamic, but also makes it more awkward to single out one kid. Safety in numbers and all that. I went to lots of slumber parties.\u00a0\n\nSleepovers were just one friend sleeping at another friend\u2019s house. This allows for a relationship to be built with the friends parents (good or bad) and it seems sketchier and easier to groom/isolate the one kid who turns up semi regularly. I only had sleepovers with the kid next door."}

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Today is our son's 10th birthday.. husband's behavior making me feel sick to my stomach\n\nMy husband has always acted jealous of our son.  We have 2 children together, our daughter who is 13, and our son who turned 10 today.   We have been married 13 years (& together for 20).  My husband used to make dinnertimes at home so unbearable because our son wasn't a very good eater and he would get on his case endlessly at every single meal.  My husband started this when our son was a baby, and he harassed him every meal up until the past 1-2 years or so when my son slowly changed and started eating better on his own. Meals aren't perfect, he still watches our son like a hawk at meals looking for any behavior to correct or remind him to keep eating but it's a big improvement.\n\nSo now the big issue is my husband has this weird way of communicating with our son that he has never done with our daughter.  For example,  when our son talks,  he acts like he couldn't understand a word our son said and acts like our son spoke gibberish.  My husband will basically mock him by repeating some gibberish phrase back but never respond to what our son is sharing (both of our children speak 100% clearly- no speech delays or problems-and I never have any issues hearing what he said). Another thing my husband does when our son talks is constantly try to make him feel small/poke lots of holes in his ideas when he shares them,  almost like he enjoys this.   He doesn't usually do this to me or to my daughter and just listens to what we have to say/ has a regular conversation about it. But for our son he makes a point to try to make him seem like he doesn't know what he's talking about or will find something he said to ridicule him. \n\nWhen my daughter was young we had a conversation about not making fun of her speech as it was developing as a rule and most definitely no name calling and we stuck to that rule with her, but he doesn't grant the same to our son. Today is our son's 10th birthday and I called my husband in the morning when he got to work to tell him he forgot to tell our son happy birthday before he went to school (he's in the 4th grade).  My husband's response was we celebrated it yesterday so he doesn't feel bad (I wasn't calling to guilt him,  I was just letting him know). \n\nThis evening I took my son to our daughter's basketball game and we got home later than usual, around 8:30.  He was seeing his dad for the first time today and while we were snuggling and talking about the day he was born lovingly,  my kept calling out son a turd repeatedly.  I was trying to share hugs/ happy moments and my husband just kept on with the name calling It was really grossing me out and I talked to my husband that it's gross/juvenile/obnoxious for a grown man to play that way & think that name calling is funny.  It's literally giving me a horrible feeling in the pit of my gut as I write this out.  My husband got pissed at me and said I'm too sensitive and to leave him alone for the next 2 weeks while he studies for finals.  \n\nHubby isn't physically abusive but I am beyond worn down with him not listening when I say I don't like what he's doing to our son.  I've given him 10 years to stop and while it's getting slightly better in ways in others I just don't see it changing as far as the communication dynamic he has going on rn. He refuses to go to therapy,  says \"I'm the best dad\" yadda yadda I know he isn't the worst but my God he could definitely step it up in the parenting area. I don't want to raise our kids without him but I don't know what's gonna be more damaging in the long run.  I'm getting into therapy for this,  but I couldn't get in until after Christmas.  I'm looking at jobs and houses out of state cause the way he acts like a bully makes me not like him if feel this bad feeling in my gut when he's around or i think about him. I'm losing respect. \n\nThere was another man at the trampoline park we took my son to yesterday who called his son a gross name and it makes me sick to see grown men bully their sons and try to play it off like it's just a funny joke he has going with his son.\n\nR\u00e9ponse du papa :", "completion": "This is going to seriously impact your son\u2019s self-esteem and confidence into the future.

I try and lean into my own curiosity about life and pass that along to him but he\u2019s just over one, he needs wildness and goofiness. I let him lead and try to just follow along and explain things. I don\u2019t know. What are my other boring parents doing right now to keep these wild children happy? \n\nI feel like in the same way an introvert trying to play extrovert for a day is draining, being a boring person and trying to be silly all day drains me. Any ideas folks? \n\nUpdate: After revisiting this post I immediately texted my husband to inform him that I may, in fact, be funny. Thank you all for the ultimate rebuttal for every future debate over my comedic stylings. But on a real note, thank you all for the ideas, advice and encouragement. What a wholesome and heartening bunch of responses, can\u2019t wait to finish reading all of these. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nR\u00e9ponse du papa :", "completion": "I\u2019m an un-silly parent. I try to come up with things that don\u2019t have me acting goofy. My son liked to \u2018help\u2019 with laundry, so I had him throw the laundry in as hard as he could. Then he came up with loading the washing machine with his toys. We also go on long, long walks. We look at every bug and flower. (This is what my un-silly dad did with me and I loved it.) We also race each other, where I let him run ahead so he thinks he\u2019s winning. We spend a lot of time outside to work off the energy."}
{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Update: I\u2019m 16 and got my girlfriend pregnant\n\nI can\u2019t link my last post but here\u2019s a small update to it.\n\nI\u2019ve talked to my girlfriend she said she won\u2019t get an abortion. We\u2019re still deciding between keeping the baby or adoption, it\u2019s one of the hardest decisions I\u2019ve ever had to make. \n\nAs for our parents, they do not know yet. I haven\u2019t worked up the courage to tell mine yet. My biggest fear is disappointing my mom and I\u2019m not ready to hurt her. But I know I have to, I\u2019ll try to this weekend. \n\nI\u2019m starting to pick up extra shifts at my job for extra money but as of right now I\u2019m focused on school and basketball. \n\nThank you for all the advice. As harsh as most of it was, it made me realize I was being selfish and certain things didn\u2019t matter. Thank you. \n\nEdit \nI told my mom today during my lunch. she didn't say anything over the phone but she had me drive myself back early and we talked at home.\nMy mom was hurt about it and cried. She had questions like \"why if we gave you everything\" etc, ultimately she's upset but it's okay. I told some of my friends, the people l've been with for the longest. They're all supportive. it got to some of the wrong people so almost the whole grade knows but it was bound to happen anyway. I have friend/teammate (graduated) who was on the basketball team last year and has a baby on the way as well, his gf still goes here as a senior. We've gotten advice from both of them.\nI did lose my car, gf privileges, and after/out of school activities besides my sport. Overall it hurt but the punishment was valid. We're discussing giving the baby up for adoption or possibly keeping it. Thank you for the advice.\n\nEdit: made the final decision to keep the baby. I\u2019m still trying to make my mom feel better\n\nR\u00e9ponse du papa :", "completion": "Rip off the bandaid and tell your folks.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : My 15 year old son cannot be nice to my wife, his biological mother.\n\nFor context my son is a good kid. Nearly straight A's in school. we constantly get emails from teachers telling us he is a blessing. Parents of other children are always complimenting us on his manners and how polite he is. \n\nBut, when he comes home, his attitude towards his mother is utter trash. Yes, he does try it with me, but, very little. Between the two of us (my wife and i), she is the one who is more likely to do something for him. Pick him up from school, go and get McDonald's, Cave when he asks for the playstation. \n\nMy wife and I grew up very differently, and I take more of a tough love approach. My son does not fear me, but most of the time, he respects me. \n\nHe will walk in the door and just start on my wife. Wether it's because she had subway for lunch and he didn't get any because he was at school or he is asked to do the dishes and will just crack, carrying on saying he is the only one is this house that does anything. \n\nThis afternoon, while asking him what today's problem was. He told me he has \"nothing else\" to take his anger out on. \n\nI don't know what to do he is always so \"whatever man\" when I talk to him about it. My wife is breaking down over this, and I feel like I have tried everything that I could think of.\n\nAre there any books, videos, or advice anyone can recommend to send me in the right direction to get my son back on track before I lose it?\n\nR\u00e9ponse du papa :", "completion": "You need to stop him. Sit him down and explain he can\u2019t talk to your wife that way.\u00a0\nThen I suggest your wife stop doing everything for him.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : 4 year old admitted she did not listen so her dad would yell at me\n\nI'm so ashamed of this post that I created a throwaway account. This is just a rant, I'm too ashamed to tell anyone about this whole thing. \n\nLast night my toddler pushed all of my buttons, I kept asking her to \"please stop making that sound\" \"please stop pulling my hair\" (it wasn't hard, just annoying), and just generally doing everything so I kept asking her to stop until my husband exploded and yelled at me saying that was more annoying than anything the child did. \n\nThis morning, I asked her what happened that she wasn't listening to me. She admitted she got mad at me at dinner because she wanted to play and not eat and I told her no TV and I wasn't going to play until she finished her meal (which is not clearing the plate BTW, she just had to finish eating as in \"I'm full\" then she would have been done), she said she was mad at me so she wanted her dad to yell at me. \n\nI'm devastated because she is aware what makes us tick, as in, she knows her dad gets overwhelmed easily enough, and that she would purposely do something to hurt me. \n\nIn regards to my husband, I am doing everything in my power to leave, but unfortunately, he's the breadwinner, I moved to this country because of him, so I don't have a large support system, and we have a prenup. I'm saving to move out, but unfortunately it won't be super soon. \n\nI'm feeling so defeated in knowing my tiny human that I love so much, I'm failing her so hard that she's turning into a mean person.\n\nR\u00e9ponse du papa :", "completion": "This is a sad situation.
