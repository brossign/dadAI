{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Signing off as a NewDad. I have just one piece of advice\n\nI've been meaning to get off Reddit for a while now - but it's been the few great communities like this one that have kept me on. \n\nBut I don't feel like a new dad any more - my youngest is 15 months and my oldest is about to start JK in September.\n\nWhen I think about him starting school, I'm feeling my stomach turn. It's a cliche, but it's true: the time goes so fast that you're blindsided.\n\nLooking back on the last 4.5 years, my one piece of advice is this: **treasure these days.** \n\nThere are hard parts, very fucking hard parts. And you don't have to pretend to like those. We all take joy in the milestones - the first smile, first steps, first words. But don't take the mundane for granted. The 78th super early morning where it's just you and the baby. The millionth trip to the park. \n\nThere's going to be a day, and you won't have that many birthdays before it comes, when that little one isn't a little one any more. And it might not feel like it now, but you'll feel a pang for those days. But they'll be gone like cotton candy in the bathtub, to use an example my son enjoys illustrating.\n\nYou'll never get them back - but you have them right in front of you now. Don't let the hard parts make you forget that you're living days you'll look back on with a smile in 5, 15 and 50 years. Drink it in.\n\nBest of luck guys. As we like to say around here, you've got this.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": ">There are hard parts, very fucking hard parts.

I have reached for the, \"crawling is acceptable.  Crying is acceptable, quitting is not\" saying almost weekly. \n\nNGL, looking forward to the day they're going to school.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : I spent $3000 on anger therapy as a new dad. Worth it.\n\nBasically had severe anger issues coming into the first few weeks as a new dad. People who know me will say I am very chill dude so this came as a surprise.After a couple of episodes I realised I needed therapy or I might lose my marriage/family.\n\nNine sessions later I realised I have deep-seated self-esteem issues due to childhood trauma. I get triggered into rage with criticism, and with a new baby this is of course fertile ground.\n\nIn any case, I know I can't be alone in this journey, and not everyone has the time/resource to take therapy so I'm passing some techniques on for anyone who is struggling.\n\n**1. C.R.A.P**  \n**Criticism, Rejection, Abandonment, Perfectionism**  \nThese are the four horsemen of the anger apocalypse. Learn to identify them and treat them like four old pals who ride into a room when a triggering situation appears. Learn to smirk at them and say : \"ah yea, it's you again, ye old cunt. What doth thou want from me now?\" Like mirages, they don't bear the weight of scrutiny and tend to vanish pretty quick.\n\n**2. THE FORK IN THE ROAD.**  \nAt every decision there is a choice: to react negatively and launch into a defensive pattern, or do the thing that leads to a person you value yourself to be (aka: don't react, consider the possibility that you might be gasp...wrong). Therapist told me: \"BOTH of these routes will lead to pain and anguish. But ONE of them leads to a better situation.\" This was a revelation. Once I saw this as a fork in the road, it was easier to take the path to a better me.\n\n**3. DROP THE ANCHOR.** This is a technique where when you see red, you immediately \"drop anchor\" and name three things you can see, three things you can hear, see, taste, smell, touch. Say them softly to yourself and repeat for a few minutes. Your blood pressure will tank.\n\n**4. THE SHAPE OF RAGE**  \nClose your eyes and try to detect where the anger is in your body. For me it felt like a red hot iron \"axe-head\" shape on my chest with razor tendrils going up the inside of my throat. It was extremely uncomfortable. Try to deduce the colour, texture, material of this shape, breathing in and out slowly. After some minutes, I found the metallic-ness of the axe head became plastic, then transparent, then thin like gossamer. I realised that all feelings are transient and if I had acted during that period where the axe head was the most \"solid\" I would have acted in accordance with a bloody mirage. Silly!\n\nAnyway those are the the main points. Not even sure if anyone cares to upvote this, but if I get enough I might add a couple more.\n\nHappy parenting!\n\nEdit: A word.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "Thank you for sharing, this is really interesting.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : 3 Years Into It\n\nMy oldest turns 3 next week and we have a 7 month old. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned.\n\n1. Being a husband to a new mom is, in many ways, more difficult than being a dad to children\n\n2. As fathers/husbands, we take care of our children and take care of our wives. We are expected to be the calm in the storm. There is so much focus on making sure mom is okay; no one checks on dad or recognizes that dad may need a break. We need to advocate for ourselves. Maintain your humanity.\n\n3. Parenthood is like dealing with constant death and birth. The child you know today will be gone before you know it, never to come back again. What you are dealing with now is very temporary; both the bad and the good. At the same time, you get to know them better as they grow and evolve.\n\n4. Kids are more resilient than we give them credit for. Let them make mistakes and hurt themselves, it‚Äôs how they learn. You don‚Äôt need to be perfect; in fact, being a perfect parent may hold them back.\n\n5. I need to do rough and tumble play every day or they get wound up(I have two boys.. YMMV)\n\n6. Take your own lead, it‚Äôs okay to do things differently than mom. They don‚Äôt need a second mom. They need a dad. \n\n7. The best gift you can give your children is to treat their mom right. They look to your relationship as a model of how a man should treat a woman.\n\n8. ‚ÄúMore is caught than taught‚Äù. They see and remember EVERYTHING. \n\n\nI say ‚Äúyou‚Äù in here a lot..

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Last night was the scariest night of my life\n\nMy wife and I welcomed our second child, our first son into the world yesterday at 6:36pm. So this story has a happy ending...but I'm still a bit shaken up and just wanted to get it off my chest. \n My wife had gestational diebities so her midwife induced her at 39 weeks. So we knew the date he was going to be here. We were planning everything weeks/months in advance. My wife had a birth plan and wanted to go as natural as possible. Her first pregnancy she felt like choices during delivery were taken from her and wanted this time to be different. Of course I agree, it's a intense experience and the feeling of control can help in the moment. However I reminded her constantly that being flexible in the moment would make the unexpected easier to manage. \n\nThe day of everything is going great. We're at the 20hr mark and she's stuck to her plan. She's laboring and progressing perfectly. Handling contractions as well as anyone can but there wasn't any point when she asked for pain meds and had to be talked out of it. I couldn't have been more proud of her strength. \nWe got to the point when her water broke which was a big milestone moment for her bc that was one of the moments that got taken from her the first time. Contractions picked way up after that. Bc of her diabetes she had movement and heart monitors on her at all times and it became apparent to the nurses and midwives that during every contraction baby's heart rate dropped significantly. I was so focused on my wife and coaching her through the contractions I wasn't making the connection that the slowing beeping that was happening the background was a bad sign. Or that the looks on the nurses and midwife faces were growing more concerned. My wife noticed though. Through everything she was going through she started asking \"what's happening? Is he okay? What's wrong!?\"\nThen within 5-10minutes a doctor came in and said we needed to get the baby out immediately, a group of nurses rushed in and unplugged all her cords and monitors, and our midwife quickly explained that during contractions the baby's heartrate dropped significantly and they needed to do something now. \nI rushed to my visibility terrified wife's side. Told her I loved her. kissed her. Told her she was going to be safe. Our son was going to be safe. And if I'm being honest that felt like a lie because I didn't know in that moment that they would. Almost as soon as I finished saying those words she was pushed out of the room and down the hall door an emergency C Section. I was told someone would get me if I could be in the room. Five minutes later someone came to tell me I wouldn't be allowed in the room and someone would be back to give me an update. \nI was trying to remind myself to be flexible. This was just one of those unexpected situations. But my mind went to the darkest future. I don't really want to detail that future but I will say I was alone in that room sobbing for over 30 minutes until someone finally came to tell me our boy was safe and healthy and my wife was being stitched back up and that everyone was going to be fine. \n\nThe three of us have been in the recovery ward all day together reeling from the experience. Her and I have been periodically breaking down throughout the day this processing the feeling like we almost lost each other. I know that's not reality. I've been holding our boy I'm so grateful for him. I still feel like I'm going to need to crawl into bed when I get home and sob until this dread leaves my body. Which is a feeling completely new to me. I've never been a big crier. Not too manly to cry. I just usually process feelings differently.

He‚Äôs still trying to figure out pooping sometimes and his nights/days are backwards, but overall he‚Äôs not the hard of a kid (relatively speaking). My wife, however, has been struggling since the start. She was hospitalized only three days after we brought him home because she was having constant panic attacks and didn‚Äôt feel safe around baby. Her family moved themselves into our house when she was admitted. This is great for her, but I don‚Äôt like people in my space other than my wife. I‚Äôve felt uncomfortable in my own home for weeks, feeling like a guest in someone else‚Äôs house. It‚Äôs both a social thing and an OCD issue - both of which have gotten worse the longer they‚Äôve been here.\n\nAnyways, yesterday was my birthday and my wife completely melted down. She admitted to having suicidal thoughts which is obviously scary to hear. We talked to her psychiatrist and they didn‚Äôt want to admit her again and take her away from baby if there wasn‚Äôt any intent (which I agreed with), but I don‚Äôt want her in the house right now either. She doesn‚Äôt know it because I‚Äôve been taking care of the baby mostly solo, but he‚Äôs officially hit the colicky/purple crying phase. I definitely don‚Äôt want her around while that‚Äôs happening to add to her stress. I told her and her mom to get a hotel nearby so she can get some quality sleep and detach from the situation. Her aunt had finally left on Sunday but the only way my wife would agree to the hotel plan is if her aunt came back and stayed with me at the house. I know it makes her feel more comfortable so I said yes, despite knowing that it won‚Äôt help me.\n\nTo add some additional context to all of this, I‚Äôve basically been a single parent in every sense so far. I‚Äôve been taking the full night shift so my wife can sleep and only getting about 3 hours myself in the morning. I‚Äôm sleep deprived as hell and obviously very on edge.

For instance, last night I was finally getting my son to sleep and she decided it was a great time to make a lot of noise by doing the dishes and taking out the recycling. Just a few minutes ago I almost just started bawling because I found her doing laundry when I asked her four times to leave it to me. I need her out of the house but I know my wife will not handle me being alone well, even though I know it‚Äôs what‚Äôs best for me. She‚Äôs terrified that I‚Äôll fall asleep with the baby or have a mental health crisis of my own so she thinks I need someone with me because that‚Äôs how she handles things.\n\nBetween my wife‚Äôs mental health and her family being here still, I feel so damn lonely. I don‚Äôt feel like we‚Äôve become a family yet as there‚Äôs been effectively no intimate time with just the three of us. My wife has also made comments about not feeling connected to baby so I feel like I‚Äôm isolated from her further because I so am. I miss my wife and want her to be here with me and my son. I want to give him baths together and go for walks without someone yelling ‚Äúdon‚Äôt forget a hat!‚Äù from the other room. And while all of this is happening, I need to keep it bottled up so I can be my wife‚Äôs rock and let her focus on herself. I don‚Äôt know man. This is shit is hard.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "Holy cow. The fact that you are able to express all this stuff is a great sign that you can get through this and things will get easier.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Expectations vs Outcome.\n\nI have been wanting to write this post for a while, for the new(er) dads.  I say it that way, as being almost 2 years in, I am still a new dad myself.\n\nYour past will affect the parent you are now.  I had a rough childhood growing up.  I grew up with yelling and anger being normal.  Mom didn't like something, she yelled, and spanked.  I lived in constant fear.  I was terrified of what kind of father I would be.  \n\nWhen my son was born, he would not go to sleep for myself or my wife some nights.  I would get so absolutely frustrated.  I read Dr. Harvey Karp's book \"Happiest Baby on the Block\" and honestly, even with my son being almost 2, it comes in handy.  The tricks to burp my child and get him to sleep really did help, however, sometimes, on those nights where he would not go to sleep, I would get so angry and frustrated.\n\nI felt so terrible and so guilty for how I felt.  I wanted to set a better example than I had.  My wife and I argued a lot in those early months.  We (me more than her) both had expectations of how things were going to go.  I would be rocking and gently bobbing my son to sleep, and he would keep screaming and screaming, and anger and frustration would well up inside me.  I was so angry at him.  Why couldn't he just go to sleep?  I would bob him harder, and harder, and catch myself and stop.  I understood that I was not angry with him.  He is only a few days/weeks/months old, he has no clue what he doing.  Compared to his previous home, it is cold, loud, and bright.  He can't tell me what he wants, what he needs, that he doesn't like how I am holding him.\n\nI've seen many posts in the nearly two years I have been in this group (I mostly lurk) with dads posting similar stories, sometimes they did actually shake, sometimes they had violent thoughts enter their head.  And for the father who gets angry and frustrated with their new child, but can understand that they do feel this way, and can have the control to stop and either put the child down, or hand them off to mom or another family member, you are doing great, you are a good father.  As that child grows, your patience will be challenged.  It is not the child trying to make you angry, but rather, it is them trying to figure out their way in this world.\n\nI have come a long way in the 18 months since I used to get frustrated.  By simply telling myself over and over again that my son is simply trying to understand this world, I have found a level of patience and understanding that I have never had before.  It has made a positive impact on every aspect of my life.  I have held true to my promise to my self to never yell at my son, and I tell you, sometimes, he gets into bad situations.  He will just look at me, smirk, and do something he's not supposed to, but I actually think it's hilarious.  I hold my laughter and put on my \"dad\" face and voice and redirect him, even if I have to pick him up and remove him from the situation, never raising my voice.\n\n  \nSorry, this turned into sort of a rant, but I want the dads who are new and who feel like they are struggling to know, you are not alone.  I cannot say parenting gets easier, but you do start to get the hang of it after a while.  If you are second guessing yourself, that usually means that you are genuinely trying your best.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "Ty for sharing OP.

I know that people asking questions around here may seem trivial or petty in their own ways, but these people are teaching out to other guys who've been in their shoes.  I think a lot of the time, people just need to be reassured that things are going to ultimately be okay, but i see so much \"you just need to suck it up, you're a dad now\" there's a point at which that's reasonable advice but i just read a post where OP got down voted to hell for expressing concerns about physical intimacy.\n\nWere his expectations perhaps a bit high, probably,  we've all been there, but fatherhood is a big lifestyle change and it can be a shock for the first time dad.  Instead of just saying \"hang in there buddy, it sucks, but it gets better with time, here's what you can do\" we got an awful lot of \"how dare you expect physical intimacy, dipshit?!\" That was hyperbolic,  but that's how it came off to me.  \n\nAs dads, i think we can do better.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "I would disagree, I think this group is extremely supportive and positive compared to many other social media groups and subreddits.

My wife(37) and I(36) were going to the store to look at fire pits for a 4th of July sale, when my wife noticed she started gushing down there.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Turning a corner\n\n5 weeks this week since the birth of my son and I feel like maybe we've finally turned a corner. Breastfeeding has been impossible due to, well, we thought a lactation would tell us, but she didnt. We thought cutting the tongue tie would fix it but it didn't. We thought practice, patience and technique would fix it, but it didn't. He also wasnt sleeping through the day, requiring constant soothing, various other problems that in the grand scheme of things were really, really minor, but in the moment they really, really take a toll.\n\nLooking after the baby isn't too hard in and of itself, what's hard is doing it whilst still doing other things: eating, sleeping, resting, cooking, cleaning, working, taking care of another child, spending time together as a couple, spending time alone, exercising, reading, talking to other adults. It's been hard, and taxing, and frustrating. As a couple we've handled it as well as we can, with moments of tension but a united front. It's still hard. We've had help from family and it's still hard. We've done it before, and it's still hard. We have time, and money (not lots but enough!) and it's still hard. We have so much information and access to professionals and it's still hard. \n\nI've felt bad for finding it hard. We've had no serious health issues. He doesn't even scream, he just fusses a lot. He sleeps well at night, as well as a baby can. I work from home. Our older daughter is amazing. I do not know how people do what they do, given how hard I've found it even though it's been close to perfect. But damn, it's still hard. Emotionally, physically, mentally. \n\nBut it feels like this week things got a little easier. He's sleeping better, so we are.  He's eating better, so we are. He's sturdier, he's more aware. Maybe he's even smiling a little, or maybe it's gas but who cares. \n\nEveryone said it gets easier, and there were dark nights that it felt like terrible platitudes that meant nothing and did nothing to alleviate the stress. They felt like false promises. Like when someone says the water isn't that cold in the pool. It's useless advice that's totally accurate. It hurts to begin with and then you adjust and even if you're still a little cold in the pool, you're ultimately glad you got in. You feel like standing on the side would have been more comfortable, for sure, but that's not why you came. You came to do things, and by god is having a child doing something. It's not for everyone, and nobody should feel bad for not wanting to get in the pool, or have a child. And for sure there's some rationalisation going on when you say \"oh but it's all worth it when the baby says daddy.\" \n\nBut, like the expression about the safest place for a boat being the harbour, I'm learning in real time that the easy life I was creating, the time, the peace, the calm, the financial freedom....there's time for that later. Maybe. I don't know for sure, but the thing is, I'm here now. And they were right.

It was maybe 5-10 minutes but it felt like a lifetime. After this I carried him to the car so my wife could take him to daycare. Told him I loved him and gave him a big kiss. After they pulled off I went into my office and was paralyzed with anxiety and emotions and just couldn‚Äôt stop crying and began to hyperventilate a bit. I am tired. So tired.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : I Can 100% See Why People Get Divorced\n\nI'm the SAHD of three (8/6/3). I take care of 95% of parenting and household tasks. My 24/7 life is being there for my wife and my kids. This summer, I froze my gym membership. We have no help, even with the two older kids doing various summer activities, I had at minimum one child with me all the time. My wife works. I was able to give up drinking cold turkey four months ago and change my diet and lose 30 pounds. \n\nSchool started up again, I finally got to go back to the gym again (literally the one thing I do exclusively for me, alone, during a window in the morning when all three kids are in school and my wife is at work). My wife gets to work out whenever she wants (although she very often doesn't go at all). My wife has been on me about losing weight, eating better, being healthier. \n\nOne year when I gave up drinking for two weeks, I bought flavored seltzer water and I was criticized for spending money on that (it was literally $1 for a huge bottle of seltzer). I've been criticized for not working out, for eating badly, for being overweight. \n\nSo of course the weekend was all about my wife and kids, not a shred of an actual personal break or activity for me. Monday I have to run two very important errands for my wife on opposite sides of town, so no gym.\n\nCut to this morning. I'm getting the kids ready for school, trying to get them out the door, we're already five minutes late, my wife calls  our 6 y/o over to spell a word at the table. Wrong moment, but I said nothing. I let them do it. I kept getting our 3 y/o ready.\n\nFinally getting all three kids out the door when my wife goes into one of the kids' bedrooms and discovers that last night while she was at a work event in the evening, the kids were playing with this one toy puzzle that was in the master bedroom that has these plastic puzzle pieces that are now strewn all over the floor. \n\nSo my wife gets irritated about this, lets me know and tells me to pick up all the puzzle pieces and put the toy back together and to do this, and I quote, \"Instead of going to the gym.\" \n\nIt's been almost 6 1/2 years since I became the full-time stay at home parent. That was when my middle was a newborn. But I can't go to the gym.\n\nI can completely see why people with small kids up and leave and get divorced.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "This post has been flaired \"Support\".

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : How I ended up admitting I was an angry dad.\n\nI'm posting this, so you don't have to feel isolated in your struggles with this. I've seen a few guys in here mention they snap off too fast; but being angy dads have many forms. The realization started with..  \n  \n\"Why do I feel like I'm always on edge?\" (Shoulder tight, jaw clenched)  \n\"Am I overreacting, or are my kids really pushing my buttons?\" (I'm justified)  \n\"Why does my partner keep saying I need to calm down?\" (She should deal with herself or give me a break)\n\nThese questions ran through my thoughts for a while before I finally came to it... I was an angry dad, and I was in deep denial about it.  \n  \nIt started with comments from my partner. \"You're being too aggressive,\" she'd say. Or, \"You're angry all the time.\" I'd brush it off, thinking she was exaggerating. After all, I wasn't throwing things or hitting anyone. I was just... passionate. Right?\n\nWell... to be honest, no.\n\nThe moment it really hit me was during a family game night. My youngest knocked over the board, they were fidgeting all over the place like they do.. scattering pieces everywhere. I was on my feet, before I knew it shouting about carelessness and respect. As my voice echoed in the now quiet room, I saw it - overreaction, abruptness, kids stunned (maybe scared), the disappointment in my partner's face.\n\nI wasn't just having a bad day. I was the angry dad. Literally the guy at the camp ground you want to go over to and say dude, come walk with me, let's chill out.\n\n**Fuck.**\n\nI've learned that angry dads show up in a bunch of ways.   \nIt's not just Homer choking out Bart.   \nIts shutting down because I felt overwhelmed, it's not speaking to my partner about things that mattered to me, because it might escalate, it was not hearing her, because I felt done wrong by...\n\nAny of it sound familiar?\n\nThe phases that followed? Man, they were a rollercoaster:\n\n1. Denial: I spent weeks trying to convince myself it wasn't that bad. \"All dads get angry sometimes,\" I'd think. But deep down, I knew this was different.\n\n2. Bargaining: I caught myself thinking, \"If the kids would just listen, I wouldn't get so mad.\" But that was just another way of avoiding responsibility.\n\n3. Guilt: This one hit hard. The shame spiral is real, folks. I'd lie awake at night, replaying every outburst, every scared look, every slammed door.\n\n4. Anger (ironically): I was mad at myself, at the world, at the fact that I even had to deal with this. It felt unfair, like I was being punished for trying to be a good father.\n\n5. Depression: \"I'm a terrible father. My kids deserve better.\" This thought played on repeat in my head for weeks.\n\n6. Acceptance: Finally, I had to admit it: \"Yeah, I've got an anger problem. Now what?\"\n\nThat guilt and remorse? It's a beast. I wondered if I'd screwed up my kids for life. It's fucking painful, and it should be. But - and this is crucial - I couldn't let it paralyze me.\n\n**Here's the tricky part: owning my shit without drowning in it.** I needed to find that sweet spot between taking responsibility and maintaining enough self-love to actually make changes. It's like walking a tightrope while juggling flaming torches. \n\nSome days, I crush it. Other days, I fall flat on my face. And that's okay.\n\nWhat's helped me:\n\n1. Therapy: Yeah, I know. But trust me, it helps to have someone to untangle this mess with.\n\n2. Mindfulness: Sounds woo-woo, but learning to pause before reacting is a game-changer.\n\n3. Apologizing: To my kids, my partner, myself. It's humbling and healing.\n\n4. Self-care: Head down, get through it, grin and bare it.... Does last long brothers.. I had to find what fills me up, gives me energy.\n\n5. Support: Whether it's other dads, online communities, or my partner. I'm not alone in this.\n\nRemember, recognizing the problem is half the battle. I'm already ahead of the dads who never confront this side of themselves. It's a long road, but man, it's worth it. My kids deserve it, and so do I.\n\nJust remember: I'm not a bad dad for struggling with anger. I'm a human being, willing to do the hard work of breaking cycles and being better. I'll keep at it, and if you're in the same boat, I hope you will too.\n\nStay strong, but stay humble, stay on the path.\n\nHigh Fives and Dad vibes dudes.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "[removed]"}

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Update: My baby is dying\n\ntldr for those who can't handle any suspense >!she didn't die!<\n\nHi daddit\n\nI [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1dosga5/my_baby_is_dying/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) a month or so ago about my beautiful baby. The tldr is that she was suffering mysterious seizures. An MRI revealed she had suffered a massive brain bleed and would not survive without a lifetime of medical intervention. \n\nWe opted to remove her breathing support. We  were fully prepared for her to die in our arms. We had heard from the neonatologist that she might die in five minutes or two hours. She wouldn‚Äôt last the night. \n\nWe sat our 3.5 year old down to explain it. Baby sister was sick. She was dying. She would not come home with us. I barely got through those sentences. \n\nWe had family visit. We lit a candle. We said our goodbyes. We listened to beautiful music, had a wonderful photographer come by, and waited. A few times our daughter had apnea spells of several minutes. She‚Äôd stop breathing and as the Cat Stevens wound down, we‚Äôd wait and start crying and, like clockwork, she‚Äôd take a big breath, not ready to die. We practiced unsafe sleep the entire night cuddling her and when we woke up, she was still with us. Completely asleep but still alive. \n\nWe spoke with a local children‚Äôs hospice and were admitted immediately. One of the transfer paramedics excused himself as we were loading her up. He came back from the bathroom having obviously been in there crying. \n\nIn hospice, the prognosis changed from the initial five minutes/two hours to more like a month, tops. Even an unfed baby can last a surprisingly long time. And what we talked about was ‚Äúremoving interventions‚Äù. No breathing tube, no food being injected into her. We‚Äôd feed her for comfort and that‚Äôs it. No one expected her to last long. She‚Äôd have a few nights with her long apnea spells, but she didn‚Äôt die. We explained to our older kid again: baby sister was sick. She was dying. She would not come home with us. \n\nWe treasured every minute like it might be the last. We didn‚Äôt put her down for days. She was always in our arms. \n\nWe had therapy, we went on outings, and we played with other very sick children. It was lovely. They helped us figure out benefits and programs and such. They phoned around to local cemeteries so we could figure out a memorial (DYK: many have a baby section and don‚Äôt charge you to use these services?). We figured to deal with this admin before the inevitable and we were fucking wrecks. We imagined the memorial, what we‚Äôd ask our friends to give in lieu of gifts, where we‚Äôd have it. All that. \n\nSo we fed her for comfort. They‚Äôd give us a little syringe full of formula ‚Äî 1 or 5 mls ‚Äî and we‚Äôd give it to her. We‚Äôd wipe the inside of her mouth with a sponge every now and then as her mouth was always dry. \n\nAnd. \n\nThis fucking kid, guys. My fucking baby. You wouldn‚Äôt believe it. \n\nSoon, she was taking more and more food. The syringes were gone, out came the bottles. She was alert. Dads, I heard her beautiful voice and her beautiful cry! It was the sweetest and most beautiful sound I‚Äôve ever heard. I saw her eyes again. She looked at me and I looked at her. \n\nShe kept eating. Staff were confused. Doctors said it didn‚Äôt change the path we were on, but to treasure that time. \n\nBut instead she thrived. No one knows how or why but, fuck it, she didn‚Äôt die. \n\nShe‚Äôs eating a lot now. She‚Äôs pooping and crying and soiling diapers and doing tummy time and stretching and making all those weird and silly sounds that newborns make. Three separate doctors have all said some variation of, ‚Äúif I didn‚Äôt know any better, I‚Äôd say this is a perfectly healthy baby.‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm at a loss for words, dads. This is the closest thing to a miracle I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. \n\nWe‚Äôve left hospice. The prognosis is uncertain. The doctor there thinks if she survives for a year ‚Äî and she probably will ‚Äî he can make a better judgement at how she‚Äôll fare then.\n\nBaby sister is sick. She is dying. But she came home with us. She‚Äôs on the changing table I made, she sleeps in her older sister‚Äôs old bassinet, she wears the silly clothes we bought her. All the baby shit we thought we‚Äôd throw out in our trauma is hers now. She‚Äôs in our home. She's doing baby shit. She's rocking tummy time, she's getting plump and fat. It‚Äôs the happiest I‚Äôve ever been. \n\nShe almost certainly has brain damage that we‚Äôve yet to identify. We have a follow-up with neurology and tests and all that other shit. She‚Äôs on anti-seizure medicine. We‚Äôre set up with an incredible paediatrician (our daughters old one who happens to be a fucking all-star neonatologist), we‚Äôre ready to do the occupational and physical therapy, we‚Äôre set. \n\nBut there‚Äôs still grief. \n\nWhen she was admitted to NICU, we grieved the small stupid shit. Dad pulling the car up, helping his wife and his daughter into the car. Early in NICU we learned she might be somewhat disabled. Then they determined she‚Äôd die immediately. Then she‚Äôd die in weeks or months. Now no one knows. It‚Äôs like getting hit by a car every fucking few days. Yeah I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs here, I love her so fucking much. But grief is about what you‚Äôve lost. Sometimes it‚Äôs a person, sometimes it‚Äôs your reality. \n\nWe had silly plans. When she was due to die any time, we were going to hit the gym, hard. We were going to use the grieving period to become absolutely fucking jacked. It was a great plan! I bought a fucking guitar so I could learn that (I‚Äôm still determined but free time is at an even greater premium.) We got books on grief for ourselves and our kid and read them for a death that didn‚Äôt come. We learned how to deal with death and her death. We planned on being a little sad for all of our lives. To never forget our little baby. For our big kid to always be a big sister, no matter what happened. \n\nBut now we don‚Äôt fucking know. It‚Äôs terrifying. And yeah we can still hit the gym and I'm still practicing guitar. Just with a newborn around. \n\nShe might be wheelchair-bound. It might be worse. She might be ‚Äî and pardon the frank and maybe impolite language ‚Äî a vegetable. And that‚Äôs obviously a concern. That‚Äôs a life of who knows what. \n\nWhat do we do? Can someone tell me it‚Äôs going to be okay? How do you cope with something like this? Not just the unknown, but what we might actually be looking at‚Äî that is, profound disability?\n\nAre there any books you‚Äôd recommend for this? For me, my wife, or my daughter?\n\n\nPost-script:\n\nThe nurses and doctors who work in NICU and hospice are fucking angels. We had a NICU baby in 2020 and they were simply the best and it‚Äôs been no different here. They‚Äôre above and beyond the best people in existence. If angels exist, they‚Äôre NICU and children‚Äôs hospice nurses. \n\nAlso, thanks again to anyone who read my last post and this one. Your kind words then really meant a lot. \n\nPPS: I didn‚Äôt know where else to put this but I was also going to get a vasectomy. With our kids uncertain future it seems risky to go ahead (we definitely don‚Äôt want three kids), but also disrespectful I guess not to. \n\nEdit: I'm gonna try to go through and reply.

Annoying but whatever. Then, they were strong enough to jolt me out of twilight sleep as I tried to sleep. Then they were past the point of just discomfort, but, and I want to make this very clear, they were *not* painful. Then, they were time-able. I will not post my timing or exact pain here because if you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôre basing your decision right now on comparison and the hope that someone else went through your exact current scenario. You can‚Äôt do that; I‚Äôm so, so sorry I wish it was that easy. No one will have had your *exact* scenario right now. \n\nSo, I called my midwife team five times and they I guess forgot about me (a story for another time), so for four hours I did all the things the internet said to do. I drank a ton of water, I lightly walked, I rested with my feet up, I tried to sleep. No change. I researched prodromal labor and saw that it wasn‚Äôt abnormal to start this early and so I kept trying to sleep it off, waiting for that higher authority (my midwife) to make the decision for me. Midwives can be wrong. Or ‚Äúbusy‚Äù. \n\nEventually after that four hours, I knew that I had to make the call, I was that higher authority. I was not making a call for myself, but for a tiny baby who literally had no voice. Thinking of it that way made it easier. So, we woke up my 3 year old and off to the hospital we went, a 40 minute drive. It was 2 am. We had no plan for care for our pets. Our 3 year old was scared and confused. Our bags were random crap we had no idea if we needed. Yes, going to the hospital is inconvenient. Please do it anyway. \n\nLong story short, with some gnarly meds, we were able to stop my wonderful baby girl from being born at 30 weeks. I‚Äôm still in the hospital and things are uncertain, but if I had held out for that phone call (still mad about it tbh), or if I had kept telling myself that it wasn‚Äôt happening to me, that I was overreacting to something normal, if I had taken my husband‚Äôs caring but concerned ‚Äúare you really sure about this‚Äù face to heart, I‚Äôd have had a 30 week old preemie on my kitchen floor with no steroids, antibiotics, magnesium, NICU staff, etc. \n\nI had no risk factors. I‚Äôve been the picture of a perfectly low risk pregnancy, no huge events, traumas, not even intercourse to kick this off. Everyone is stumped, and sometimes, *it just happens*.

A few hours later I started having PAINFUL, inconsistent contractions so we went in. I was told they were only Braxton hicks contractions and that it was just discharge that I had been leaking all day (it did not look like discharge to me AT ALL but whatever) so we went home. They told us not to come back in until the contractions were consistent and a certain amount of time apart. All weekend I kept having these painful contractions so I called again and they told me the same thing not to come in. I ended up calling once again because the pain was unbearable and they still had the same recommendation not to come in until they were more consistent. At this point I think there were tired of me calling because they did say ‚Äúwell we aren‚Äôt that busy right now so if you want to come in you can but you likely aren‚Äôt in labor‚Äù. I wasn‚Äôt even going to come in because they brushed it off again but in the back of my head I just felt like I should. \n\n\nWe decided to go in because I just really kept feeling the need to. The nurse came in and started a non stress test. Within 5 minutes they had rushed in 4 nurses and one doctor and advised me to quickly get up on my hands and knees on the bed. One nurse trying to find the heartbeat on a Doppler, one with the non stress test, another attempting to put an IV in to rush me back for an emergency csection because THEY COULDNT FIND THE HEART BEAT. The anesthesiologist stood outside waiting. This was easily the most traumatic experience of my life. Finally they found the heartbeat but said it was dangerously low and they needed to take me back for a csection. \n\nWe weren‚Äôt even at the hospital for more than 15 minutes before they took me in for a ‚Äúrushed‚Äù cesarean.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : My Experience Having a Baby With Clubfoot\n\nHello there! I wanted to share my experience having a baby with clubfoot because I remember desperately searching Reddit for any information after we received the diagnosis to help understand what things would look like. \n\nIn late 2022, during my anatomy ultrasound, I noticed the ultrasound tech spending an extreme amount of time surveying the baby‚Äôs legs and feet. It was fairly evident that something wasn‚Äôt right based on her reaction, but she let us know the doctor would call us with our results. My heart sank and I started googling and a few hours later had come to the conclusion that it was probably clubfoot. The doctor did not, indeed, call us. Instead, I found out that my son was going to be born with a birth defect through a MyChart notification. I‚Äôm still salty about that. \n\nI got very upset and took a day to process before I called my mom and told her. She goes ‚Äúoh, I had that‚Äù as if it was no big deal, an afterthought. Here I am in an anxiety spiral and she just brushed off the fact that she forgot to mention this in the 30 years I‚Äôve known her. Later down the line, once I‚Äôd calmed down a bit, I appreciated how minuscule a blip it was in her life. It wasn‚Äôt something that impacted her as an adult and it hadn‚Äôt crossed her mind in decades.\n\nAt my next OB appointment, I was referred to a geneticist and a high risk OB. The geneticists laid out my options to do more extensive testing and we discussed our family history and we opted to do a blood test that they described to be like the NIPT but with more information about potential chromosomal issues. Based on our family history and the ultrasound results, they thought it unlikely that there would be a comorbidity that would be of any concern so we felt good about that. \n\nThe rest of the pregnancy was mostly uneventful. His kicks felt sharper than my previous pregnancy. I grappled with some guilt and worked through it. I found the clubfoot Facebook groups and spent a lot of time reading there so I would know what to expect. That ended up being a bit of a double edged sword because I saw all kind of complications, complaints, and disagreements that probably stressed me out more than what was necessary. \n\nThe delivery was uncomplicated, but there was a constant stream of curious medical personnel for a while, and one nurse very delicately asked me if we had known about the clubfoot or if it was a surprise lol. The first weeks he was like any other newborn, except when he would scrunch his legs up, his feet would pound into his genitals and then he would get upset because it hurt. That was something I hadn‚Äôt expected! If we had been planning to circumcise, that would have made me chose to delay the procedure until he had casts on his feet to prevent unnecessary discomfort. \n\nWhen it came time to see an orthopedist (around 2 or 3 weeks? It‚Äôs been a while), I looked all around the major metro area we were close to to find a ponsetti specialist, but there were none in the area. If you are a parent reading this, the ponsetti method of treating clubfoot seems to be like the gold standard. In a typical case there are no major surgeries and a low rate of relapse if you follow the method. The closest ponsetti specialist to us ended up being Dr. Dobbs, , who is like the Ponsetti superstar in the south east but who was 4 hours away, so I opted for someone more local. \n\nThe first set of casts my son received looked like lumps. The knee was not bent at all 90 degree angle as I‚Äôd read was optimal and I couldn‚Äôt really see his toes to know if his casts had slipped. I‚Äôll include pictures, but it didn‚Äôt feel right. We still stuck with this doctor and the next week got a second set of casts. When we went back for the third set, my son‚Äôs skin was completely raw and irritated and the doctor recommended going without casts for a week. Over night his feet completely returned to their original position at birth and we had completely lost any progress. It was devastating. I reached out to Dr. Dobbs and he emailed me back that night! I described the treatment we‚Äôd received and asked if that was typical (to which he answered no) and asked if he knew of any doctors in my area that he would recommend for the treatment (also no). I decided then to make the switch and deal with the long drive and see him as our doctor and that was hands down the best decision I could have made for my son. They were able to see us just a few days later to restart the casting process. Because we were not local, they were able to slightly accelerate the process which meant my son was receiving new casts every four or five days instead of every seven. \n\nDealing with the casts themselves as a parent was not a huge deal. They were heavy and bulky and sometimes made it hard to snuggle up the way I wanted to and required support while breastfeeding. We were still able to do tummy time. I had to roll up a blanket under baby‚Äôs knees to keep him comfortable while he slept and he did have a poor quality of sleep at first and following the day or two after each new set of casts. It was a sleepless period for sure, but we made it through. \n\nI would suggest putting leg warmers over the casts. Poo will make its way over there and you can take off and wash the leg warmers. Once it‚Äôs on the cast, you‚Äôre stuck with it until the next set. It‚Äôs not a big deal, but I would definitely recommend bringing leg warmers with you to that first casting appointment. \n\nAfter casting was over (5 or 6 rounds with Dobbs if I remember correctly?) it was time for the tenotomy. This is where the doctor makes a small incision and clips the Achilles tendon to release it. Many doctors do it under anesthesia but Doctor Dobbs and his team were able to do it while baby was awake with just a local sedative which I was grateful for. I was a mess handing him off to the nurse, I felt so bad knowing I was passing him off for him to be put in pain that he wouldn‚Äôt understand. A short twenty to thirty minutes later they brought him back to us in the recovery room. He fussed a little but I definitely cried more than he did. For our son, the tenotomy ended up being such a nonevent. He didn‚Äôt seem to be in any discomfort and napped most of the drive home. All in all, it was incredibly uneventful. \n\nDuring the tenotomy procedure, they placed him in his final set of casts. By this time we were old pros. The next appointment (a week or two later maybe?) we came back and his casts were removed and he was given a brace called boots and bar. \n \nMoving on to the bracing part of treatment was the BEST. In comparison to the casts, the boots were lightweight and allowed baby to move his knees. We could cuddle more easily and closely. Most importantly, we had four periods of fifteen minutes a piece where we could take the boots and bar off, do stretches, and he was free to move as he pleased. It was heaven getting to give that stinky baby a proper bath! He had a hard time sleeping the first few nights in the boots and bar and we had to cut open the bottom of his sleep sack, but once he adjusted he slept much better overall. \n\nOver the next year, we went from 23 hours of brace wear to 22, to 18, and now he just wears his brace during naps and at night time. We have struggled with the condition of the skin on his feet from time to time. Sometimes his straps will be too tight and leave a welt, we‚Äôve been battling athletes foot and had some success with lotrimin during the day and antiperspirant spray before bed, but overall, his clubfoot is such an afterthought now. I don‚Äôt look at him and see the clubfoot, he‚Äôs just a kid that sleeps in some funny looking shoes. He will sleep in some manner of brace until he‚Äôs four.\n\nHe was a little slow to crawl but started walking at 13 months. Now he runs and climbs! (Send help). \n\nThere‚Äôs still a chance he could relapse and we would need to do the casting and tenotomy and bracing again, and I hope that doesn‚Äôt happen, but I know if it does that it‚Äôs something we can handle. This mountain that felt so gigantic during my pregnancy turned out to be a mole hill. \n\nIf you‚Äôre a parent finding this post, even years later, and you have questions for me, please feel free to send me a dm. Know that you can do this! And get leg warmers for the casts!\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "This was great to read.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Update: I gave my baby daughter herpes (HSV-1) by kissing the top of her head\n\nI shared my story here about one year ago. I wrote the story in the hospital the morning after our daughter was diagnosed with HSV-1 and while waiting for my wife to wake up. I thought I should share the story again to try to make more people aware so they may be able to avoid a similar or worse situation. Below is the link to the post:¬†[https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1724y9l/i\\_gave\\_my\\_baby\\_daughter\\_herpes\\_hsv1\\_by\\_kissing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1724y9l/i_gave_my_baby_daughter_herpes_hsv1_by_kissing/)\n\nTo summarize, I kissed the top of our 6.5 week old baby on the top of her skull while I had a cold sore and it resulted in her being infected with herpes (HSV-1/the cold sore virus). I did not know that infection could occur through regular skin. Growing up I was only taught that it could spread through contact with the mouth or lips, and I only learned about infection being possible to genitals or breasts as an adult. Prior to the kiss, I think I may also have been unaware about the seriousness of infections to babies and was trying to prevent its spread to our children solely based on on the discomfort and embarrassment I endured in my own life as a result of developing cold sores.\n\nOur daughter was provided with IV antiviral treatment for one week in the hospital before we were discharged. We were given a prescription for one week's worth of oral antiviral medication to be taken from home, and had a follow-up appointment with the infectious disease doctor around a week after discharge. Although they were unable to take a sample of spinal fluid to check if HSV had spread to our daughter's central nervous system, they thought that the virus was likely only skin deep in her case. And we were told that we would need to come back to the children's hospital immediately if the sores presented themselves again (I assume at least until she is one or two years old).\n\nOur daughter has had one or two outbreaks of HSV-1 since we initially left the hospital. The first of those outbreaks was around three weeks after leaving the hospital and resulted in a hospital stay overnight followed by about two months of oral antivirals to be provided from home. And the other time was around one month after using up the antivirals from the previous outbreak but the sore went away on its own within 24 hours. We were going to pickup antivirals for the last time but all pharmacies were closed so we decided to wait until the morning, but the sore was almost fully gone by the morning. Both recurrences showed up at the same location as the initial sore and kiss (top of skull).\n\nMy wife met with an infectious disease doctor in February to discuss our daughter's case, and the doctor said that \"\\[our baby\\] got really lucky. There are limited treatment options and \\[our baby's\\] case was very minor compared to most.\"\n\nShe seems to be a very happy and healthy baby. In my opinion, since she was about midway through her stay in the hospital she seemed to be in a happier place and is still there as long as she isn't wanting to be held or nursed by her mom. My wife and I both agree that she has been the happiest of our babies. And we recently celebrated her first birthday.\n\nI have posted this story to a number of different subreddits to try to raise awareness, especially for parents or soon-to-be parents. Many users have expressed gratitude for the posts because they were unaware regarding the dangers of HSV or how infectious it is. So I am glad to have possibly helped prevent some similar or worse cases from occurring. A user also commented not too long ago on an older post of mine suggesting that I \"share it over and over\" because they think the information is valuable, so I thought I should do an update post here to help spread the info some more and give an update to anyone who saw my earlier post.\n\nTL;DR: I gave my baby daughter a single kiss on the top of her head and now she has herpes (HSV-1). But she seems to be doing ok, and I have been trying to help others avoid a similar or worse situation.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "Thanks for sharing your story and for the update.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Final Update: 43 week pregnant friend has admitted to not being pregnant.\n\nA lot has happened in the last 24 hours. Previous posts can be found in my history. I'll link to them later.\n\nPregnant friend will be called El in this post for simplicity sake.\n\nEl has told different friends different stories over the last couple days. She told one friend that she gave birth yesterday, but another friend that she gave birth today and is already home and doing well. The friend closest to her was able to find her home address (she moved recently).\n\nFriend went to the delivery hospital to double check that she wasnt there. They confirmed they had no patient with that name. She called El. She asked El where she was and El said she was leaving the hospital right now. Friend said \"well I am here so I'll help you walk out\". That's when El broke down and admitted everything after my friend was able to meet her at her house. Here's the gist:\n\nEl visited her boyfriend in Europe. A few weeks later, she thought she might be pregnant. She took a test and it had an incredibly faint line. She started posting in pregnancy FB groups asking for confirmation. Then she went to the doctor and asked for an ultrasound. They confirmed that there was no baby. El was convinced they were lying to her. She says she went to another boutique ultrasound place and they did a 3d scan and found a baby and did an entire pregnancy scan. (We don't believe this actually happened). Then El started getting symptoms, her belly starting growing and she fully convinced herself that she was pregnant. She did maternity photos, prepped for a baby and told her workplace and parents. She never went back to the doctor because she was convinced they were all lying to her.\n\nOnce she hit \"full term\", she starting getting anxious. She thought she was cramping, losing her mucus plug, and her water broke. She didn't know what to do because the doctors wouldn't help her. Once she went past 43 weeks, she decided to go to the hospital (yesterday). She showed up with her hospital bags packed and her parents went with her. She told the front desk that she was 43 weeks pregnant and was ready to have her baby. I don't know what all happened here but they basically turned her away and told her she was not pregnant or having a baby. We think her parents started to figure it all out a week or so ago, but didn't know the extent of the lies. They have always let El do whatever she wants and pay for her entire lifestyle. We assume she lied to them about everything.\n\nFriend said El does have a swollen belly that looks like she's 20ish weeks. They talked for a long time and she is grieving this lost pregnancy/baby. She legitimately thought she was going to give birth.\n\nWe think she is suffering from a phantom pregnancy. Thank you to the redditor who told me about this. I had never heard of it.\n\nWe are all very upset for her and realize that we need to be very careful. We are not going to attack her or confront her as a group. We have a mental health resource ready to help her, if we can delicately get her to agree to go.\n\nThis is not how I thought this would all play out. This is all so unbelievable.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : I kept having nightmares that my baby was tangling himself in his umbilical cord throughout my pregnancy and it turned out to be true (true knot)\n\nFrom about 12 weeks onwards I kept having regular nightmares that my son was tangling himself up in his umbilical cord and it was hurting him. I mentioned it to literally everyone, it was almost an all consuming fear at one point. My OB told me there was nothing to worry about, the baby looked perfect. I had multiple ultrasounds throughout my pregnancy due to being high risk, and even the ultrasound tech said everything looked fine. I was able to push it out of my mind for the most part but about a week before I was induced I kept seeing dead baby animals literally everywhere I went. I told my husband about it and he said it was just a coincidence and not to think too much into it. \n\nFast forward to 38 weeks. I was induced due to hypertension (not pre-eclampsia related.) After about 24 hours of labor, my son started having decels every time I had a contraction. He also had what the doctors called an ‚Äúominous heart beat‚Äù when he wasn‚Äôt deceling, like his heart rate would not go above a certain level even if they were messing with him. This baby had literally kinked his head in the birthing canal to prevent himself from advancing further. The doctors tried twice to manually reposition him (aka putting their entire forearm inside of me to do it.) We ended up rushing for an emergency c-section because the attending just had a bad feeling about it.\n\nThank god for that doctor because my son would have likely been a still born if we hadn‚Äôt done the c-section. He had what was called a ‚Äútrue knot‚Äù, where at some point early in the pregnancy he had moved around so much he had caused a knot in the cord. They said the knot was extremely tight and white. When I told the doctor and nurses about my dream they told me it gave them goose bumps. The OB nurse that took care of us had been a nurse for 25 years and told me having a true knot was extremely rare and that he was the first baby she took care of that had one that wasn‚Äôt still born or needed a long NICU stay. \n\nAnyways, I just had to tell someone about this. I am not a very religious person but I do believe something was guiding me and preparing me for the delivery while also protecting my son. He is now a healthy 7 week old and I thank god every day for the awesome OB team I had.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "Leading up to my scheduled c section I was terrified I was going to die, then the day before the c/s I woke up and my worry had changed to, what if something‚Äôs wrong with the baby and I worried about it all day.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Everyone tells you about reduced fetal movements but nobody told me about excessive movements\n\nTW: Stillbirth \n\nI was pregnant with twin girls until a few weeks ago and due to the high risk nature of my pregnancy I was seeing a consultant every 2 weeks as well as having an ultrasound every 2 weeks. Let's just say I was at the hospital A LOT. \n\nAt every Dr appointment I was told to come in immediately if I noticed reduced movements. I never noticed reduced movements ever. The girls were generally active and I got to know their schedule pretty well. They liked to party in the mornings and evenings mostly with the rest of the day having less energy but still reassuring me that they were fine. \n\nThe night before my last scan my girls were moving so much that my bump was completely changing shape, lopsided to one side then to the other side, coming up down and every which way. Very vigorous movements that it was painful for me. I figured they were partying and tried to get some sleep. \n\nIn the morning I headed to the hospital for my scheduled scan and the Dr asked how I was and how were the babies' movements. I told her about the party the night before and laid down on the table ready for the scan. Twin B was easier to scan since she was more accessible higher up so the Dr started with her and all was good. Then she moved on to Twin A down into my pelvis and she struggled to find her heartbeat. Sometimes that happens because of her position so at this point I was not concerned. Then Dr starts asking me what time I had breakfast, whether I'd taken my blood thinner injection this morning and whether my husband was working today. That's when I knew something was wrong. She called for another Dr to come and check Twin A, she said he had more experience and would be able to get a better look. When he came to scan he was quiet, and after he checked he quietly spoke to my Dr and left. \n\nThen she told me. Twin A had passed away. I didn't believe her at first. I could still feel movements really low down. She said it was Twin B's movements pushing her sister that I could feel. She said we really need to get Twin B out today and I would have to be prepped for a C-section as soon as possible. She told me to call my husband and arrange childcare for my older kids so he could be with me. \n\nI had to be put to sleep for the surgery because I had taken the blood thinners and also had breakfast so I was at high risk of bleeding out. Twin B was taken straight to NICU and I was not able to see her for 6 hours after she was born. Her dad visited her and I was told she was ok, she needed some help in the beginning but she had stabilised and was doing well. \n\nThe Dr who performed the C-section told me that sometimes whether is a one off instance of excessive movements that can be a sign of distress in a baby and it was very likely she was struggling the night before and we just didn't realise it. I looked it up afterwards because I had never heard of this in any of my 3 pregnancies and it is not very common but a one off incident of excessive fetal movements is one of the indicators of a stillbirth. Everyone always mentions about reduced movements but if I had known about excessive movements then I would have headed to the hospital the night before and maybe I wouldn't have had to bury my child. \n\nI'm putting this here because I think it's important that people know what to look out for. It's not something that's ever talked about but it could be the difference between life and death for a baby. \n\n\nTwin B is doing well btw, still in the NICU but just working on feeding and growing now before she can be discharged.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "I am so incredibly sorry for your loss; what a horrific thing to experience.

My birth plan was always ‚Äúget baby out of me safely with few interventions‚Äù so, well, I guess I got my wish? \n\nSo I posted at 40+6 last week.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : I am so glad that I did NOT have a birth doula\n\nPregnant with our first child, my husband and I kept hearing endless benefits of hiring a birth doula. We were planning on a natural unmedicated birth, and it sounded like a good idea to help us navigate the process- lots we didn‚Äôt know about.\n\nWe ultimately decided against it. The cost was about $2k and we didn‚Äôt love any of the candidates we were talking to. Despite friends and family recommending a doula, we weren‚Äôt feeling that the benefits were strong enough to outweigh the cost. We decided that my husband would fill the role of mediator between me and the hospital staff, advocate for our preferred birth plan, and coach me through the pain management techniques we had identified beforehand.¬†\n\nBirth was INTENSE, but everything went well. My husband filled his role as ‚Äúdaddy doula‚Äù magnificently. He‚Äôs naturally a very caring, mindful, and competent person; he felt up for the tasks, and after it was all over, we both agreed that a doula would have just gotten in the way and taken energy away from us.

As a mother's day outing, I took her to a play. It hadn't really occurred to me when I purchased the tickets, but the show's total runtime was about three hours, so by the time we got to intermission around the two-hour mark, I had to pee so bad. I ran downstairs to the bathrooms, but realized by the time I got down there that there was only one set of bathrooms in the entire theater, which was packed out. The restroom line was therefore absurdly long and snaked around the entire room. So I just bit my tongue and hopped in line. \n\nThe lady behind me noticed my (at this point very large) bump and said, \"You know, you could cut in line and nobody would care.\" Since I generally struggle with asking for help and don't want to come off as entitled, I tried to politely refuse (which in hindsight was pretty silly of me). Thankfully, she insisted and turned to the women standing next to us (about 20 people ahead of us in line) and asked if they'd be willing to let me ahead of them in line. They all gasped when they saw the bump and said of course. Then they asked the women standing in front of them if they'd let me through. This started a chain of people letting me in front of them until I got to the front of the bathroom line within about 2 minutes.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : What I wish I knew pre-baby\n\nOur little one (first baby) is three weeks old today and I have been thinking since he was born that I wanted to write a summary of all the preconceptions I got wrong before he arrived / advice I would give to expectant parents, having recently gone through pregnancy and birth. The reality is very different than I expected. Here are my main takeaways:\n\n1. Stop reading negative posts. I read so many negative stories about difficult births and was subscribed to a postpartum depression group during pregnancy, so absorbed a lot of negativity. I did this because I wanted to prepare myself for the worst, if it happened. But in the end I had a very easy birth and the first weeks of his life have been great, with no hormone crash so far. It's been a magical time really. I wish I hadn't scared myself by reading so many negative things before birth. Worrying doesn't change anything. I have been very pleasantly surprised by how easy and lovely the experience has been (I know that's not the case for everyone and I am lucky). \n\n2. Breastfeeding is a minefield and I wish I had been more prepared, even though I took a class in advance. I wasn't knowledgeable about alternatives for when breastfeeding does not work. I stayed in hospital for three days after the birth and we ended up having to kind of beg our hospital for formula at the end of day 2, when my milk had not arrived and baby was clearly hungry. It felt like the hospital which is very pro-breastfeeding did not want to even give us the option of formula initially. And I had not realised that in Belgium where we live, the official advice is to use bottled water for formula, not to heat it, and not to sterilise bottles - ie. It's super easy and we did not need to buy a bunch of stuff we thought we did. I soldiered on with pumping regularly and that's had some results but I also wish I practised at my leisure with using an electric pump before birth to harvest colostrum, rather than learning in a stressed out way once baby was earthside.\n\n3. Speaking of buying stuff... we have loved having a dedicated changing table, would recommend getting one, even though I read mixed opinions on this before he arrived. And a spare bed in the nursery has been great, so that me and his dad can do 4 hour shifts at night, to ensure we both get a minimum amount of sleep. One thing we have way too much of is baby clothes. Between gifts and donations the baby has a bigger wardrobe than I do and I pray nobody gives us any more clothes for him. Baby clothes can be bought for practically nothing second hand so don't buy new stuff!\n\n4. The sleep deprivation is a bit tougher than expected even as an experienced insomniac. We have had some early luck with bubba by encouraging longer wake windows during the day but it's too early to tell really. I also miss going to bed with my husband, but accept it is a necessary solution for now and won't last forever. \n\n5. The first trimester was by far the worst for me in terms of fatigue and nausea and it really rattled me. I was a zombie for 3 months. Have faith that it will get better! The second and third trimesters were not easy exactly but totally manageable. \n\n6. Finally, weight gain. I put on about 60 pounds in total, about half of this in the first trimester. I found this so, so psychologically hard given that all the advice says you shouldn't gain anything in the first tri, and many women actually lose weight in this period due to morning sickness. But I learned that this is totally unique to each person. As the pregnancy progressed my weight gain slowed, and I also stopped caring, marvelling instead at what my body was capable of doing. I wish I hadn't stressed so much about weight gain. Half is already gone in the first three weeks post partum and the decrease in my hunger levels now is really noticeable. This is one subject I would encourage new moms to read posts about as overwhelming most women seem to have the same advice.\n\nGood luck expectant parents! There are wonderful things coming :)\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "I am 17 weeks pregnant and your post has given me so much hope!\n\nI, too, have a tendency to read a lot of negative pregnancy stuff online.

As my kids have gotten older I‚Äôve observed that some kids are simply more mild and easy going than others. Part of that is their genes, part of it is their personality, part of it is their birth order, part of that comes from whether they are neurotypical or neurodiverse...

Fetal macrosomia, especially at extremes (most providers say 11lbs and above) can increase risk of severe complications like shoulder dystocia. When babies reach a certain estimated size, the risk of these severe complications greatly increases. Is a risk a guarantee that it‚Äôll happen? No, but as with anything, each individual needs to do their own risk assessment and decide how much risk they are willing to accept.

Managing risk is essential to a safe delivery.\n\n\nIf you really want a vaginal birth and know you might end up with an emergency c-section, that‚Äôs fine!

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : I Gave Birth Playing Tug-Of-War with a Nurse\n\nI wanted to share the two ways I was asked to push when in labor because I had literally never heard of them in any of my research or seen it in movies or anything. They were brought about because I was having a really difficult time pushing for as long as they wanted me to without throwing up or gagging. \n\nThe first was literally playing tug-of-war with the buffest nurse in the unit. I was on my back, feet in stirrups and they brought in a sheet and I would hold on to one end, she the other, and when a contraction hit I would pull as hard as I possibly could. It was so surreal but it totally worked, my baby started coming out. Something about being more focused on the tug of war than on pushing?\n\nThe second was essentially the same principal, but they had these holders near the foot stirrups where I grabbed as if I was about to do a bicep curl and again once the contraction started I would pull against the holders as hard as I could.\n\nGod damn were my arms sore after but those methods were by far 10,000x more effective than just straight up pushing for me. Anyone else when their game of tug-of-war?\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "Both exercises in that position were engaging your abdominals - the muscles needed to help push baby out!

I did this for myself to make more informed buying choices and thought it might be useful for other parents. I was surprised by how much the price varied, sometimes one store would be twice as expensive in some cases.\n\nMy number breakdown comes from- Diaper package sizes differ dramatically by brand and store location. In order to level the ground, I broke down the cost per diaper to find a flat comparison point.\n\nI opted to use the largest diaper box size, simply because it is usually the most cost effective way to purchase diapers.\n\nThese are the flat prices, meaning I did not take into account subscription services (including Target Red, Amazon Prime, or membership fees for Costco and Sam‚Äôs). Nor did I take into account sales or coupons, since those are sporadic. However, they can make a significant difference for an aware purchaser.\n\nFor stores, I tried to focus on places that are national (and fairly wide spread) or prominent online.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Update: Mom in law throwing herself a Grandma shower\n\nHey Everybody who remembers me posting about how my mom in law stopped helping with my baby shower because she was planning her own ‚ÄúGrandma shower‚Äù and didn‚Äôt want to invite her friends or family to the actual baby shower because she already planned one for herself. The comments from everyone made me feel less crazy for thinking this is a ridiculous idea. Also the advice I received from you all was really helpful. We ended up having our shower at my parents house an hour away and were able to invite some old aunts. The shower turned out great and I was actually surprised that 3 of my aunts came. Also I did like you guys said and invited my mom in laws friends that were important to my husband even though my mom in law told us not to, making them realize there was actually a baby shower happening. Guess what?!? They all came and supported us and were even willing to drive over an hour to get there! One of her friends even posted on Facebook all the photos from the shower about how much fun she had! And another one of mother in laws friends commented that we didn‚Äôt get to invite ‚Äúoh no did I miss the baby shower?‚Äù and my mom in law comments ‚Äúno you didn‚Äôt my grandma shower is next weekend‚Äù proving the point that her friends have no idea the mom to be isn‚Äôt going to be there at the grandma shower.

I have many mutual friends on Facebook and was sure to post our photos of our baby shower so any mutual friends know it already happened. I did see that one of the friends who she told us not to invite to our baby shower because she would have to choose between her grandma shower and ours was actually out of state this weekend.  Looks like she didn‚Äôt go to grandma shower after all because she went to ours. I‚Äôm obviously not close with mom in law to ask her how it went so if there‚Äôs anything interesting I‚Äôll let you guys know. \n\n***Update #2 \nMom in laws friend posted a tik tok she made of MILs baby shower. It looks like it was at a friend‚Äôs house and there were maybe 10 people there.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : UPDATE: Friend won't be induced until 43 weeks\n\nLots of folks wanted an update so here's the latest! Here is the previous post for reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/s/bPP85QAZDx \n\nMy friend said her water was starting to leak on Thursday around 2pm. She said her doctor told her not to come in until her contractions are 4 min apart. She was not currently having contractions but more sharp cramps. Friday morning, I checked in on her. She said she's still not having contractions and she still plans to go in that night (last night) around 8pm. I text her around that time to wish her luck and I hope things go well, yadda yadda. She just said \"thank you\" and nothing else. No updates overnight.\n\nMy friend is a nurse at her delivery hospital and called me this morning, asking for an update because she's concerned about her water breaking nearly 48 hours ago and she hasn't had the baby. So, she called her hospital to see if my friend was there and they have no record of her checking in at all. She plans to text her this morning and see if she says she is in the hospital or what. We are all in the same group chat, for reference.\n\nThis is all just so crazy. My nurse friend said there's no way her doctor wouldn't have her immediately come in if she's 43 weeks and her water broke. I have no idea what to think. This friend is always really open and texts us all the time with random updates so the radio silence is not normal for her.\n\nUpdate: friend says she's currently at the hospital and doing well but it's possible she put herself on the privacy list. \n\n{Edited to remove private information}\n\n**I get it. Nurse friend may crossed a line. I have no idea. Just updating with what I was told. \n\nTo be continued! ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nUpdate 2: it's now been almost 48 hours since she's arrived at the hospital, supposedly. She has said multiple times that she's there and all is well. Zero pictures, updates, or information. She's responding to other messages like normal. It's been 72 hours (I think) since her water broke and she's past 43 weeks now. This friend is one who sends tons of pictures when she's doing anything exciting so... This is definitely not like her. She has volunteered pregnancy related information the last several months. \n\nWe don't know how long to let this go. We all agree that we think there is no pregnancy or baby. We've all been friends since elementary school so this is hard for us to accept. There's 3 options. 1) she's pregnant and lied about her due date for whatever reason. 2) she truly believes she's pregnant even though we are pretty sure she hasn't been a doctor. 3) she's just straight up lying. This is hard for us because she hasn't posted on social media so if she wanted the attention, why not post there too? We are thinking that she's lied about previous life events. She was once engaged for years without any wedding or meeting the supposed fiance. I'm sad for her and mad/disappointed she is lying to us. \n\nWhat do we do??\n\nUpdate 3: I don't even know how to start. Friend has supposedely been in the hospital for several days at this point. I'm actually in St Lucia right now on vacation so don't have access to our chat group via texts so trying to get updates via FB.\n\nOne friend in that text group said she reached out privately and the friend said she had the baby but was too stressed to send pics or updates. So she reached out to the other friend in the chat who said she also reached out to the pregnant friend who said she has NOT had the baby and was starting pitocin that day. So she's now telling people different things \n\nAnd now, another reddit user reached out via PM. She posted a topic on the Pregnancy subreddit about this exact story. Someone linked her to my posts. I can confirm it is indeed the same person. The main details she has shared are the same with a few things that are off from what I was told. \n\nWe are actively trying to get a hold of her parents. They moved recently and no longer have the landline number but we are very concerned.\n\nEdit 4: one friend in our group was able to find pregnant friends home address. This friend is closest to her between all of us. She is going to go over this evening and is prepared to talk to her. We talked to someone we know who is a psychologist and helped us with what to say, how she might react, etc. her parents should be there as well.\n\nPregnant friend has told one friend that she had the baby yesterday and another friend that she just had the baby an hour ago and is being discharged, which is just impossible. We think she truly believes she is pregnant based off a pregnancy test and it was likely a chemical pregnancy. She never met with a doctor because other tests were negative and I think deep down, she was afraid a doctor would confirm that there is no baby. So, she decided to carry on as if she was pregnant and now she has tricked herself into thinking she is pregnant.\n\nWe also found the baby daddy from Europe. He is married. We believe maybe they had an affair. His wife may have already tried talking to pregnant friend and accused her of lying. Or, maybe she found some random guy and made the whole thing up. We have no idea. We are going to urge her to go to a mental health facility in her town.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "Dude! I had a life long friend do this to me in 2022.

I didn't want to tell her a bout what happened at the party I wasn't even allowed to go too because I was grounded. So I lied. Then I've been up and down on what to do about the baby. I feel sick. I feel no connection but shame and regret. But the last few weeks I've been starting to think about waht if I can't put her up for adoption. Two weeks ago I had my fourth prenatal appointment. My blood pressure was a bit elevated at 145/92. They tested my urine for protein and negative. I've been monitoring my blood pressure and it's been fluctuating around 135/80 to 140/95. Today it went up to 155/95, along with a really bad migraine, fatigue and nausea. I called the doctor and he told me to go to the ER. It's been three hours, when I took my blood pressure again and it was 160/100 so I called my mom at work to come home because I was really sick and need to go to the hospital. I know I need to tell her the truth. How do I tell her the truth? Why didn't I tell her? I'm not feeling well. I'm worried about the baby. Me? I don't know what to do. She'll be home in about twenty minutes. Baby still moving as normal. I'm not sure what to do. I'm freaking out.\n\nUpdate: I'm seriously overwhelmed from all the responses. I honestly thought no one would care and judge me for being stupid. I'm in the hospital. Even after my mom came  home, it took until we were pulling up to the hospital to tell her. I was seriously so close to throwing up. I was shaking, saying I feel like I was going to pass out over and over again. It's when we were going into the ER when I just started crying and saying I was pregnant. It just all came out at once. She just kept telling me everything was going to be all right over and over again. My blood pressure was 172/101 so I was sent up to labor and delivery pretty much immedietly after I admitted I was 28 weeks. That shocked my mom. But then in the room, it happened so fast. I got hooked up to fetal monitoring, then they took blood. Then there was fifteen minutes of my mom and I. I felt so bad for not telling her, but I told her what happened at the party, and how I didn't remember, and felt ashamed, and scared. That I had intially planned on abortion, then adoption. Then now I wasn't sure what I wanted. I knew she was dealing with a lot of shit after my dad just left her for another woman last year, then this shit happened and I've been dealing with it. It just had been a lot.  She just hugged me, and we both kind of cried. Blood work came back. Some elevated levels, I can't really remember what right now. My mind is a million miles an hour. BUt they gave me something to help with stablizing my blood pressure, gave me a steroid shot for baby. As of ten minutes ago blood pressure is 135/95. In two hours they are going to check my urine and blood again. My mom is going to go home to find somewhere for my sister tos tay tonight and grab some stuff and come back. I'm going to try and sleep now that I'm feeling a little bit more myself. I had intended for this to be a short update but I guess I just needed to unpack everything. Thanks everyone who have reached out. I'd reply individually if I wasn't so exhausted.\n\n2nd Update: I didn't think posting about my experience to a bunch of strangers would actually make me feel better or I would have made an account when I first found out. Last night and overnight was a bit rough. My blood pressure kept going up and down. It went up to 160/105 I believe, but quickly came down with more fluids. I got diagnosed with pre eclampsia with moderate to severe effects. They did up the blood pressure medication, at in a few hours will give me a second steroid shot. It really honestly sounds like I'll be here until she is here. They are hoping to get me to 32 weeks but based on my lab results and urine results they suspect it could be as early as this weekend. I have been feeling more or less pretty tired, nausea and this headache that seems to be up and down. My mom has been good. I know she feels really sad I kept it from her and that I suffered alone. She wanted to call my dad to let him know what was going on, and I got really upset at that. I really don't want to talk to him, let him know anything, because frankly most of the time I don't even think of him and treat him how he treated his family when he left to make a new one. I know how I reacted to her suggesting  it brought some old wounds up and I feel bad all over again. I'm honestly still feeling overwhelmed, surreal and not sure what the hell the next week, never mind few months are looking like. Just hoping to make it a few more weeks, because apremature baby that I'm not even sure what to do with, is daunting enough.  Thanks everyone.\n\n3rd Update: Thanks for all the support. This will be quick. I haven't been feeling well. My blood pressure has been spiking and not coming down. Protein in urine, and blood work isn't great. Ultrasound is showing some problem with the placenta. I'm having the baby tonight. I'm exhausted. I'm terrified. This all feels overwhelmingly surreal.\n\n4th Update: She was born at 7:23pm last night. I was originally scheduled for an induction, but it turned quickly into an emergency c-section. I'll post more later.\n\n5th Update: This whole delivery and pregnancy has truly traumatized me. My blood pressure got up to 201/115 during the induction, and I got put under. I woke up with double vision, nausea, and just the worst sickness I've ever experienced. It took me until today to be able to muster the courage to see the baby. I am really struggling, emotionally. My mom has been handling this really well for someone who was kept in the dark. I can tell she is allready growing attached to the baby. She won't in so many words, but I know she wants me to keep the baby. I think I need a few more days, to really unpack what had happened this last week. But baby was offically born June 9th at 7:23pm 28 weeks 6 days, 2 pounds 2 oz.\n\n6th Update: July 19/2024: It's been a while since I've updated. The first few weeks were really hard. I had a hard time connecting with the baby. I had to be readmitted two days after I was finally discharged becasue of elevated blood pressure and five days later released again, on blood pressure  medication which I'm still on. I didn't want to hold her. I found it hard to pump milk, and/or visit. It wasn't until she was almost 32 weeks and over three pounds where I started to come around. I started to visit out of want versus obligation. That sound really bad, but just the whole experience had been really hard. Now that she is 34w3d, 4lb 3oz, on the lowest setting on the CPAP. She hasn't got the concept of sucking from a bottle, but is taking in 22ml every 3 hours of breast milk fortified with something to give baby extra calories. All in all there hadn't been  many serious complications and accordingto staff her stay has been uneventful for the most part. For me the whole thing is and still continues to be traumatic. I did start up on antidepressents because it was clear as day I have PDD. It has helped a lot with feeling less overwhelmed and making bonding a lot easier. Things with my mom are good, and she has been supportive. I've reached out to my dad after I had time to process everything. He has came to see the baby once, but more or less things are tense and I'm not going to put  too much effort into staying connected at this time.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "I don‚Äôt have the answer but am really impressed with your diligence and ability to maintain your appointments and check your BP despite struggling with feelings of attachment.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Dollhouse nursery completed at 35 weeks\n\nHi everyone! I‚Äôm a STM and posted my son‚Äôs nursery almost exactly two years ago, so I wanted to post my daughter‚Äôs nursery as well. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/s/trYVJdxuLJ\n\nWe went with a ‚Äúdollhouse‚Äù theme and I really love it, but it was hard to find inspiration and furniture and almost everything you search shows miniature furniture for actual dollhouses. \n\nNotes:\n\n- I like decorating nurseries. Our bedroom and the rest of our home is a mess üòÇ\n- Our daughter will sleep in this room as soon as she‚Äôs home from the hospital. We have our postpartum overnight doula coming back (loved her soooo much with our first) to help with overnight care, and find it easiest to have the baby in her own room to facilitate this. \n- The snoo is not a permanent fixture in the room, which is why it just floats in the middle of the after six months or so we will return it, as it‚Äôs rented from the company. \n- Our son‚Äôs room looks identical to how I posted it two years ago, and we even moved! I just had the wallpaper installed in his new room. I found that having a lot of organization has allowed us to put things away more easily. Now he‚Äôs a toddler and he has toys and more stuff, but everything still has a place. When he turns 3 we will probably re-design his room as a ‚Äúbig boy‚Äù room and I‚Äôll try to post that next year!\n- I fully acknowledge that this is extra. \n\nTop five products:\n\nCharlie crane crib. My 23 month old son is still in this exact crib, so we purchased a second for baby girl. I did not take into account the first time that buying a French crib means importing sheets, as the mattress sizes are different from US cribs, but I still love the crib. It‚Äôs basically a cute pack and play, but it works. \n\nhttps://us.charliecraneparis.com/categorie-produit/beds/kimi/\n\nDollhouse armoire. The whole room really centers around this armoire. It‚Äôs just so cute. The little door opens and it‚Äôs my son‚Äôs favorite place to hide his toys. \n\nhttps://rh.com/us/en/catalog/product/product.jsp/rhbc_prod482295\n\nWallpaper. It‚Äôs kind of a French cityscape? But I think it works. \n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/1502338574/kids-doll-house-watercolor-wallpaper?ref=yr_purchases\n\nDollhouse bookshelves. Affordable and so cute. \n\nhttps://www.zara.com/share/children-s-rattan-house-shelving-unit-p14_46692080.html?v1=364078276&utm_campaign=productShare&utm_medium=mobile_sharing_iOS&utm_source=red_social_movil\n\nShade store curtains. We didn‚Äôt do custom curtains in my son‚Äôs room and we‚Äôre on the third blackout curtain set because they all kind of suck. Took a gamble and ordered these based on swatches and I‚Äôm so so so happy with them. Next year we will install curtains in my son‚Äôs room as well. \n\nhttps://www.theshadestore.com/drapery/custom-drapes\n\nThings I would have done differently if my son was out of the toddler phase OR if baby girl was our first born:\n\n- moved all of the books to one bookshelf and used the second bookshelf as an actual dollhouse with mini furniture. It would be very impractical, but with a baby that can‚Äôt move for the first 6-8 months it would have been so cute!!\n- Purchased a table lamp for additional lighting. With a very curious toddler running around it didn‚Äôt feel safe having a little lamp that he could pull down, but I‚Äôm sure I could have found a cute lamp.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "BabyBumps users and moderators are not medical professionals.

We just recently moved here from FL.  I sent her a list of hotels close to the hospital/my house so that when I do go into later they can be there. (They have made it VERY CLEAR that they HAVE to be there, my MIL even demanded she be in the room while I push.

The doctor had called us a few days before our due date but a week before that my wife started feeling contractions and we went to the hospital only to find out that our baby had no heartbeat. The doctor told us that this was a completely new case for her as she had never seen anything like this considering her every measurement was in normal range. She did a C-section on my wife and told that the my wife had suffered from preclamsia within the last 24 hours and as a result the placenta had ruptured causing our baby to pass away. She had slightly lower fasting blood sugar level a day before (around 70). Obviously this came as a huge shock for us as the everything was going normally and no one ever saw this coming. But for some reason I find it very hard to accept doctor's explanation.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "I don‚Äôt think there is anything I can say that will make a difference.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Last sleepover my daughter will ever have\n\nMy daughter went to a friends for a sleepover, with another friend‚Ä¶ (will not ever be happening again, they are 11 years old) \n\nShe told me that there were ‚Äúsecurity cameras‚Äù in her friends room. When asked about it, she was told by the parents that they were for security purposes and that they were ‚Äúturned off‚Äù \n\nMy daughter could tell they were still on because the light was still on, so she placed a shirt over them. \n\nThe parent came into the room, removed the shirt, didn‚Äôt say anything and left. \n\nShe‚Äôs smart as fuck and called me to come and get her but I feel absolutely disgusted right now and do not know what to do about this. \n\nShe did not get changed in the room, but her friend did. \n\nThe mom is a respected member of the community and is involved in the school system. \n\nI‚Äôm trying to wrap my head around why they would possibly need TWO cameras in their 11 year olds room who is very well behaved, not involved with drugs or sex‚Ä¶. \n\nThere could be a possible medical reason, but even with that‚Ä¶ when you have two other children in your care this is absolutely fucked up to me.

It‚Äôs in their daughter‚Äôs room because her room is above the garage and can be accessed through the garage. She said it‚Äôs inactive and not used to watch anyone and that she didn‚Äôt even think about how it would come off to other people because it‚Äôs just always been there. \n-this is the very first sleepover her daughter has had and apologized for making mine feel uncomfortable. \n-her husband works away a lot so I understand all of the cameras for security, however I still feel weird about the situation\n-the mom said she wishes my daughter would have told her it made her uncomfortable and they would have put her in a different room. I mentioned how she did ask about the cameras and how she covered them off and said the mom came back in and uncovered them. Mom denied this and said they just have fallen off because she didn‚Äôt do that. \n-mom was very apologetic and respectful and was not defensive or dismissive. \n-given the information that I have, I am comfortable with the choices I have made.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Lost my baby tonight\n\nETA, 15 hours later: Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. \n\nYou may all just be 'internet strangers', but there are thousands of you. Reading. Commenting. Just letting me know you're here, with an upvote. Holding my son in your prayers. Promising me you will never forget. Sharing some of your own struggles, to let me know that there will come a day when it's not just all dark, anymore. \n\nUnless you have been where I am, right now, you have no idea. No idea how much this helps. Even if all you can say is that you're sorry, despite none of this being your fault. \n\nI am disheartened by the fact that a few people have suggested I might be 'karma farming'. To those who think that is what's happening here, I say: I'm sorry. I'm sorry for whatever happened to you to make you that cynical. I hope you have people in your life who can and will take care of you. Because you need it.   \n\n***\n\nYou were the best thing that had ever happened to me. My perfect little boy. You were the sun; the center of my universe.\n\nYou were confident and full of joy. You were headstrong, like your mother. You were picking up a step stool, and dragging it to where your bottle was sitting on the counter, before you'd even learned to stand up straight without support. You were walking like a pro by the time you'd turned ten months old. You escaped from daycare not even six months later, walking home down the street, and interrupting our downstairs neighbor's work-from-home day because his was the only bell button that was low enough on the wall for you to reach. That day, you told your daddy that you didn't want to stay with \"all those little kids\", anymore. It was as if you knew how little time you had. \n\nYou'd had really bad respiratory infections with long hospitalizations before. But after that day, when you came home from daycare all on your own, the horror *really* started. You got a yeast infection in your lungs not too long after that. Yes, apparently that happens. It made all sorts of alarm bells go off on the part of your medical team, and three months later, with lots of genetic testing, we found out you had a primary immune deficiency. It only got worse from there. You were in and out of the hospital with various difficult-to-treat infections for the better part of the next two years. We were told three or four times, on different occasions, that you 'might not make it through the night'. Your father left us after the second time, and then again after the third. It was 'too heavy of a burden to bear', he 'hadn't planned for this'. \n\nWe celebrated your second and third birthdays on the ward, and in-between, we went from weekly intravenous immunoglobulin drips, to long-term preventative hospitalization, to bone marrow transplant. After a long search, because you came from Ashkenazi Jews on your father's side, and apparently that makes for a rare tissue type, the transplant happened a few days before you turned three, in August.\n\nYou were genuinely better for a while, after that. With help from your grandmother as I tentatively went back to work, I even managed to send you to preschool two days a week for a stretch. You started after Halloween, and you enjoyed it. You used to get up on your school days and say \"yay, I get to go to school today, mama!\" You especially liked it when I would let you ride your bicycle to school. Miraculously, given your medical history, you were the only one there who didn't need training wheels, and you made full use of the bragging rights that came with that. \n\nBut then, one evening in late May, as I was sitting next to your bed with my hand on your shoulder, waiting for you to fall asleep, suddenly you stopped breathing. Your heart had given out.\n\nI didn't panic. I started CPR. I hit the button on my watch to call an ambulance. It worked. They came. They saved you. But four days later, while being monitored and under treatment at the hospital, your heart stopped again. It had been damaged by the chemotherapy prior to your bone marrow transplant. That, we'd known for a while. But now, something else had damaged it. Something bacterial. The doctor told me with a straight face that \"this was proof that the bone marrow transplant had worked, since it's the kind of infection anyone can get.\" \n\nThey brought you back again, and gave you a temporary pacemaker. When that didn't help much, they put you under \"just for a few days\", so as to give your heart some time to rest and heal. Nearly three weeks later, you still hadn't woken up. A meeting was called. A decision was made. You finally woke up on Thursday, June 20. I spent about four perfect hours with you. Despite my fears, you recognized me immediately. We had a conversation. It was about teddy bears. But it became obvious quickly that your heart really wasn't in it, anymore. You could lie there, and say a few words, and that was about it. Anything more strenuous exceeded your capacity. You had woken up, but to what kind of life? They put you back under again. \n\nYou were added to the transplant list that day, but I knew. I knew. Luckily, there aren't all that many four-year-old hearts available for transplant. And even if one did pop up, it was unlikely for you to ever get it. Your lungs were all messed up, from too many infections. You'd had a recent bone marrow transplant, which increased the chances of rejection for any other donor organ to near-unacceptable levels. There was some lingering doubt about your brain function, too, despite those four pefect hours. You were never a good candidate. \n\nAnd yet, there came one last flicker of hope on Wednesday, June 26. A heart in transit suddenly became available, when its intended recipient unexpectedly died before it could get to him. I received the call during a meeting at work, and I rushed to your side. But by the time I got there, the flicker of hope was already gone. The heart had been in transit just a tad too long. It wasn't viable anymore.  \n\nAnd so, tonight, I had to let you go. Forever three years old. You were the sun. The center of my universe. It will be dark forever, now.\n\nSleep tight, my perfect little boy.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : My white kid said \"N-word\" at the barbershop today.\n\nTo clarify first, he DID NOT use the actual word. But the exact phrase \"N-word.\"\n\nEDIT: Because I neglected to mention it sooner in the post, my son is 6 years old and my family is white.\n\n\nMy (36F) son (6) and I were in the city today for a doctor's appointment I had. I had seen a barbershop down the street so it was a good opportunity to get my kid's hair cut. FIL had given him a kitchen scissor chop job the week before so... perfect.\n\n\nWe walk in and ask if they have room for us and they direct us to the waiting area. Now this is a black barbershop. In my 6 years experience of trying to get a good cut for my son I've never once had luck with any salon that serves predominantly white ppl NOT making him look like Eminem circa 2004. Just bad chop jobs. I started taking him to black shops a couple years ago and he's not gotten a bad cut since. Those guys know hair.\n\n\nWe get him into the chair and the barber gets started. A little giggling, jokes back and forth, talk about the basketball game on the TV. Then the conversation went like this. \n\n\n*My son to the barber*\n\nSon: There's a lot of black people here!\n\n*Everyone laughs*\n\nBarber: yea well this is a black shop! We mostly cut black people's hair.\n\nSon: So it would be really rude to say the N-word, right?\n\n\nHis barber missed it but the one adjacent heard and looked at me as I sat wide-eyed staring at my son. I told him that, that was NOT an appropriate topic and if he had questions he could ask me at home. The cut moves on.\n\n\n*Son to the barber*\n\nSon: so why would it be rude to say the N-word?\n\nI'm again staring at him and tell him a bit more forcefully that we can talk about it at home and he's being rude.\nBut instead of dropping it his barber asked me if it was ok if he answered his question. I said yes and they spent the next 10 or so mins talking back and forth about the ins and outs of the word. Age appropriate history, how he might hear other black people say it, why it's hurtful to hear a white person say it, and so forth.\n\n\nI feel so incredibly lucky that this man wanted to have a conversation with him. He didn't have to but I know it got thru to my son to hear directly from a black man and not his white mother or a dumb kid at school.\n\n\nI wanted to share this story because it's a difficult topic to approach with a 6-year-old. And while it's not the responsibility of any POC to explain to your kid the reason slurs are so offensive if the opportunity presents itself and you get a generally good vibe from the adult...take it. It was so impactful for my son to hear from someone the slur targets and I'm very grateful to that man for being so patient and gracious on such a difficult topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n*EDIT: Wow this blew up. I'm glad to hear mostly positive feedback and I appreciate all the insight so many of the comments provided. Few questions I'll answer here since they're being asked a lot.\n\n1) No, we don't use this language at home. He goes to a diverse public school that teaches up to 8th grade and rides the bus with all ages of kids. Him hearing slurs was inevitable. I've answered his questions previously and luckily he understood enough not to use that hurtful word directly. Now he has even more context. For that I'm grateful.\n\n2) No, I'm not an AI. I hear if you ask me a cupcake recipe you can confirm this.\n\n3) Please stop sending me rude messages. I did not mean to offend anyone and you have my sincere apology if I upset you.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Baby Throwing Up turned into Brain Cancer\n\nI cannot tell you how many times I was going to post here looking for answers because my toddler kept throwing up but didn't post.\n\nMy 13 mo was throwing up for 3 months. Talked to docs, specialists, xrays and etc but nothing worked. She was starving and couldn't sit up or move her legs, was weak and her soft spot was bulging. Took her to the ER, they did a CT scan and saw a big tumor in her brain and immediately told us and was going to transfer us to a local hospital but ended up transferring us out an hour away because the neurosurgeon was out. They did an MRI and then surgery the next day to drain excess brain fluid causing pressure in her head and took out the tumor.\n\nI just hate how life has changed so much in the past 5 days. It's been in the air that she will likely need to be cared for 24/7 and it hurts thinking about it. I love my baby and it pains me to see her in pain and to think that she will never be the same baby again but I hate to say that it feels burdensome and not fair. I'm a teacher, and went to see my class on the first day of school during her surgery kus idk what i was doing and idk if i can go back to work seeing and working with abled-normal children while mine will be recovering her whole life. \n\nShe's currently in surgery right now again.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : 7 month update: Husband wants to divorce and start over, \"can't bond\" with baby\n\nI promised an update once things were over (and at this point they're *mostly* over) so here I am! My story can be seen in my post history but the short of it is that my (31NB) exhusband (29M) did not see my daughter's birth and decided that because he wasn't there he \"couldn't bond,\" so he and I are divorcing and he's going to \"start over.\"\n\nDaughter turned 1 this month. She landed on \"nod\" as her first word. I suspect this is because FIL brought home a foster-to-adopt dog a few months back whose previous owners called her \"Nod\" or \"Nodder.\" Daughter loves the heck out of this dog, you guys. FIL sends me pictures of her every day to show to Daughter. \n\nExhusband and I are just waiting on some final paper work for the divorce to be complete. He has not contested anything. He did look the judge in the face and repeat the whole \"didn't see birth, can't bond\" thing. His lawyer did try and defend that claim. He presented studies that he claimed said things about damages to bonds when fathers weren't present and actively involved for everything but exhusband was? He was there and active and involved my entire pregnancy, and was present for my entire labor until things went wrong. It wasn't a case of \"ooooh hey you knocked someone up 5 years ago, now bond with this kid.\" Daughter was definitely less than an hour old when he held her for the first time, probably less than half an hour. And I had proof for this claim too, among other things I had pictures of the two of us at multiple pre-natal appointments. FIL was also willing to file a statement talking about how Ex and he were involved in my pregnancy. \n\nNeedless to say, the judge was not impressed with my ex's lawyer's arguments. He tried to push my ex for therapy, made comments about how Ex would regret this later. Ex stood stubborn with his \"I need to start over\" line. He has visitation per the paperwork. Care to guess if he's used it? \n\nHe does also have to pay child support. If you've read my post history you might remember that he offered me a *gigantic* 50 dollars a month. That's all he's been paying despite the judge ordering a lot more so that's a fight I'm going to have to steel myself for. I'm surprised he started scanting out before the divorce was even final but he did tell me and FIL that he's not a scumbag so in his mind he's probably just keeping true to his word or something.\n\nHe's shown no interest in Daughter. No other children, pregnancies or potential partners have popped up either. As best FIL can tell, Ex is single and not showing any interest in dating yet. \n\nI don't know how I feel, really. It would make more sense if he was cheating. It would be easier to have something solid to point to, go \"fuck you into a tornado for making my life fall apart\" and then try to move on. But all lived evidence points to him honestly thinking he has to do this. \n\nI'm in therapy. I've found a place about middle of my parents and FIL, and I'm still doing freelance work. I would rate myself \"okay.\" Daughter is happy, healthy and kicking off. She will be fine. I plan to never speak to Ex again once this paperwork is done. I just have to wait to be able to totally start over myself.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : I promise you they won't miss sleepovers\n\nSince I encountered multiple episodes of inappropriate behavior and/or blatant sexual assault by men during sleepovers as a child, we've had a firm \"no sleepovers\" rule. People sometimes balk at this because the idea makes it seem like the kids are missing out. They totally aren't. Today, my daughter celebrated her 11th birthday with a drop-off pajama party from 3p to 8p featuring a cotton candy machine, Taylor swift karaoke, chocolate fountain,facepainting, hair painting, hide and seek, a step and repeat for posing for pictures, each kid signed her wall with a paint marker because her room is her space, we opened gifts and played with them from the start of the party, and we all made friendship bracelets while watching Elf. I spent very little to do the party since I made the cake and did the activities myself. If you're at all worried you'll get whining when you reject requests for sleepovers, just host epic pajama parties and you'll be the talk of the town. After a few years of doing these parties, my kids classmates clamor to get invites. This year, that meant 18 kids joined us. It was loud.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "It seems like there would be a statistical difference in risk between a slumber party and a sleepover.\n\nA slumber party has multiple guests who are together in a group. This may bring out risky group behavior depending on the kids, ages, and group dynamic, but also makes it more awkward to single out one kid. Safety in numbers and all that. I went to lots of slumber parties.¬†\n\nSleepovers were just one friend sleeping at another friend‚Äôs house. This allows for a relationship to be built with the friends parents (good or bad) and it seems sketchier and easier to groom/isolate the one kid who turns up semi regularly. I only had sleepovers with the kid next door."}

It‚Äôs that she throws in my face that ‚Äúshe‚Äôs done it‚Äù when she literally has not. \n\nMy (23f) son is 9 months old now, and I just wanted to vent. My mil is a 50+ year old who is constantly drinking, riding on motorcycles, in and out of unstable relationships. However when her two children were young and she was new to parenting her mom (my grandma *IN LAW*) watched her kids while she worked! She didn‚Äôt pay childcare! She also lived with her mom up until very very recently. As someone who knows how hard it is raising kids and how much help she needed you‚Äôd think she would want to be that person for her own child. Seems like both my parents and his have this ‚ÄúNot my child not my problem‚Äù mentality but wanna take selfies with him and go on Facebook and talk about how much they ‚ÄúLove being a nana!‚Äù Like be so for real. It also would be so much easier to understand this if they didn‚Äôt have so much help. Like I feel like this is a pass the torch kind of situation. I am aware my son is not her responsibility, but don‚Äôt tell me you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm struggling‚Äù or ‚ÄúI did it so can you!‚Äù when you had a support system and we don‚Äôt. Just the fact of not having to pay childcare would save us SO much we would not be struggling nearly as much, so she doesn‚Äôt understand that bc she had people to help. \n\nAm I making sense?

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : My kid has started calling me \"Dad\". Am I doing the right thing by letting him?\n\nMy neighbour passed two years back. He was a single father, in his mid 30s, and one of my closest friends since childhood. He was ill for several years before his passing, and we were all expecting him to die a bit earlier than you'd hope, but he passed in an unrelated accident completely unexpectedly. He made me promise that I'd look after his kid if anything happened to him, and I agreed. I meant it. I had already been helping out a lot with him before his passing due to his failing health. I expected, if I was ever going to have to take over fully, for there to be a slower transition with the chance to say goodbye at some point though. It was all very sudden when it happened. \n\nImmediately following the accident his seven year old son came to stay with me. Before I had been told what had happened this kid had already asked the police to bring him across the street to me that night. Words can not express how quickly my heart sank when I saw this kid staring off in to space at my front door with two police on either side of him. I didn't even need them to tell me why they were there. I welcomed him in, gave him a hug, and he fell asleep pretty much instantly. I put him down on the sofa and went to sit in the kitchen with the police to talk about what had actually happened. I have been looking after him for the two years since.\n\nWe moved somewhere he could have his own bedroom about two months after this. It luckily didn't result in a change of schools, which I would have felt awful about. We got visits from a social worker from time to time for most of the first year but have really been left on our own since. I don't think I ever planned to be a parent before this, so I appreciated a lot of the advice that I was given and still miss the visits a little.\n\nWe recently had two deaths in the family. One was somewhat expected, but the other was very much not. I'm still shielding him from the details of that one. Both of them were people he had grown close to and I was really worried about him being exposed to that kind of loss all over again, but he seems to be doing ok. It breaks my heart to see how easily he just accepts loss now. He shouldn't have to be like that so young. I've been doing my best to keep him happy and healthy and made it clear he can talk to me about anything, made it clear that it's ok to not be ok, and so on. School is aware of the whole situation and is making sure he is alright there too.\n\nSaturday afternoon I dropped him, now aged 9, off at his friend's, and just picked him up Sunday evening (School is currently out). He was very fidgety. I could tell something was up immediately, and wanted to ask, but I decided to wait until we got home in case it was serious. I thought it might be to do with the deaths, or, while it seemed a bit early for this kind of thing, I wondered if he might be about to come out as gay and I would want to be able to give him a hug and tell him everything was ok if that was the case. When I started to slow at a traffic light, completely unprompted, he, without a crumb of nervousness, hesitation, or any kind of forewarning, asked if it was ok if he called me \"dad\" from now on. **I felt my soul leave my body.**\n\nI was not upset at the question at all, I was just completely unprepared. For a moment there I wasn't even sure if I was going to be able to complete the drive home. I gave my best smile and said that he can if he wants to and patted him on the head, messed up his hair a little. He was beaming. He's been calling me \"dad\" more than he'd ever call for me normally. I think he is just enjoying saying the word. He has been very huggy. It's like he is bouncing around he house all the time. I have asked him a few times if everything else is ok, and he has said that everything is great.\n\nI think he really is just that happy about this. I felt so happy that he would want to call me that. I always doubt that I am doing the right thing (I think everybody does) and that just felt like the first confirmation that I wasn't doing too badly at least. I have already been thinking of him as \"my kid\", for a very very long time now, but it took him asking me that for me to realise that it goes both ways. I guess two years is a much longer time when you're that young. It all still feels so fresh to me. To him this two years probably feels like half his lifetime ago and I feel so silly that it took him asking this for me to realise that it wasn't as recent for him as it is for me.\n\nI was basking in the joy of this big life moment a little, and brought it up to a couple of coworkers when they asked what I was so happy about... I guess one of them thought it would be a good idea to bring it all crashing down on Monday afternoon. She said that I should probably have just had him continue to call me by the nickname he always has, or \"uncle\" or something (which he has never called me, so no). She's trying to make it sound like I am trying to paint over or somehow disrespect his father, and now has me worried that he might grow up to feel the same and resent me. I was thinking that it was fine because *he was the one who asked me if he could call me it, not the other way around*, and he seemed so happy doing it.\n\nIn a few years time I'll have raised him longer than either of his birth parents did. I can't really remember much before the age of seven myself, so I don't even know how much he'll even have left of them by the time he's in his teens. I try to think forward to when he's entering adulthood, and I imagine most of his big memories will be from while he has been with me. Even when his father was around I was doing a lot in those last few years. I can't help but think that not \"letting\" him have a dad when he wants me to be one and I am happy to be one for him would just be awful. To me at least I feel like him asking if he could call me \"dad\" and my response being any kind of \"no\" would just feel like the worst kind of rejection. I thought I made the right choice but now I need to hear from other people who can maybe relate to the situation whether or not I am in the wrong?\n\nI don't think I would be having these conflicting feelings at all if his biological dad wasn't someone I loved dearly also. He still talks about his dad, and calls him \"dad\" too. I don't want that to go away. I like to tell him stories about his father and have photos of me and him around the house. Even now I can tell which of us he is speaking about without issue. I've been calling him \"my kid\" almost the entire time he has been here since everyone else has called him my \"son\" the whole time anyway, and I was going to start calling him my \"son\" around people too since he started calling me \"dad\",  but would it be weird or wrong for me to start doing that? I think it's not the kind of thing I can undo once I commit to a change so I want to be sure I do everything right and now my coworker has me doubting myself.\n\nThanks for your time and I appreciate your thoughts. Sorry if this is a bit rambly.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : 3 year old left alone at the playground\n\nMy son found a friend to play with at the playground today. That little boy came up to me and talked to me. He asked whether I had water. He said he‚Äôs 3 and his dad is playing basketball. The basketball court is about 400 metres away from the playground. My son played with him for about half an hour.\n\nThen this little kid‚Äôs dad appears and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go home quickly. I‚Äôll be right back‚Äù.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : I think something inside me broke today\n\nI don't really pay much attention to things like Father's Day, Valentine's Day, or even Mother's Day, really. Not that I don't at least get my wife a card or flowers or try to make her brunch on Mother's Day. But I feel like these are kind of silly holidays that are more about driving consumerism than anything else. So I'm a grinch, whatever. Point is I wasn't really expecting anything today.\n\nWe kinda got off on the wrong foot. Kids (7m, 7m, 2f) were mass pandemonium to start the day, as usual. But just as I was getting into the shower, my wife comes into the bathroom and announces \"your food's ready\". Well that's kind, but also a surprise, since I had no idea she was doing that. By the time I finish getting ready and get out to the table, it's already cold, but that's fine. It was a sweet gesture, and nice not to have to cook. We were just out of sync is all.\n\nBut that's where it all took a turn. First, she tries to get the kids to peel away from the \\*\\^&$%!! screens and just come sit at the table for a few minutes. Begrudgingly, they show up, but barely a moment later are already trying to ditch out to get back to video games or whatever else they're doing. One of the boys, \"A\", had been whining about a game all morning because it was frustrating and he found it too hard. We told A more than once \"if it's frustrating you just take a break, it's okay, it's just a game, etc.,\" to no avail.\n\nWell, as I'm just sitting at the table trying to enjoy some time with my spouse over this fine brunch she put together, A comes up and discreetly asks his brother, \"B\", to come 'see something'. Odd, but whatever. As long as they're not fighting for once, have at. Not long after, B comes back to the table and is visibly upset. I ask him what's up, but at first he won't say, and it looks like he's about to cry. He finally speaks up, and admits that A broke the downstairs TV. Turns out A had lost his mind at the game and smashed the TV with the game controller. I can feel my blood pressure instantly go through the roof. I go investigate, and sure enough, screen is spider-webbed and the tell-tale vertical and horizontal lines obscure much of the viewing area. I don't know whether to yell or cry or smash something myself, so I say nothing and go back upstairs to keep from losing my own sh\\*t.\n\nThat makes this the 3rd TV in as many years to get destroyed by one of the kids losing their temper at a stupid video game. I have busted my ass so that they wouldn't have the kind of childhood that I had. There's no way that they can understand, and logically I get that. It's just so damn frustrating when they're so freakin' picky about food, when my family dealt with real food scarcity on a regular basis growing up. TV? We only had ONE TV--and not consistently either--much less 3 massive UHD flat panels. They want for nothing, when my siblings and I barely had clothes on our backs when we were the same age. So even though I know it's not fair of me to expect them to be grateful for something they don't understand, it still angers me how entitled and disrespectful they are.\n\nRegardless, even though I have a sh\\*t-ton to do today, took a break so we could all go to the movies and watch Inside Out 2 together as a family, as a sort of dad's day activity. The boys were actually pretty good, but now it's their sister's turn to shine, we'll call her \"C\". Screaming on the way there. Can't sit still in her seat and has to investigate the other patrons around us. Demanding and then throwing popcorn. Smashing my soda. Screaming on the ride back home. Biting or otherwise antagonizing her brothers. Even now I hear her screaming upstairs.\n\nJust...what the f\\*ck. I feel at the end of my rope between everything I've already got on my plate to keep a roof over their heads and food in the fridge. I feel like I'm drowning, and it's as if they're happy to jump on my head to keep me under.\n\nSorry for whining. If you made it this far, thanks. It felt cathartic to at least write this out, even if I still feel wrung-out and just so over it all.\n\n--------------------\n\nEdit: This kinda blew up way more than I expected! I really appreciate the kind words and support from so many of you. Definitely helps to know other parents go through it too. And the words of solidarity have definitely gotten me to a better headspace. I love my kids deeply; they're all smart and unique in their own ways. Talented and gifts galore to bring to the world. But the bottom just fell out today, you know how it goes! So this was just a snapshot of a day in the life...when everything went off the rails.\n\nI may not be able to reply to everything, but definitely trying to read it all. Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts with me.\n\nOh, and to those of you with all the stupid, judgy things to say or want to call my kids 'shitty'...I guess I'm just impressed that you never have shit days and seem to have it all figured out! **/S** üôÑ But seriously, I don't need your b.s. Today was bad enough. Take your shit out on someone else. Thanks! üòò\n\n--------------------\n\nEdit 2: Upon looking back at what I wrote when I was emotionally drained, yes, it's easy to jump to the conclusion that my kids are selfish, entitled little brats. I can see why several jumped to that conclusion and then laid into me about supposedly being a shitty parent.\n\nLook, my kids are not defined by one bad day where their dad felt overwhelmed, nor are they selfish, entitled little brats. Much less are they defined only by the mistakes they make. My kids are smart and talented, and are still figuring out how to navigate themselves and the world. They don't--and can't--understand my perspective, at least not yet. They are learning and growing, and we're using this event as a learning experience, just like any other. Punishing them and being vindictive about their mistake, especially trying to shame them for being bad kids, is not my parenting style, nor will it ever be. Doesn't mean there aren't consequences, which A is certainly learning right now. And to the commenter that I suggested hitting my kids...I have no words. That is an absolute non-starter.\n\nAnd to those kind souls that were interested in my wife's well-being, she had a rough day too, although at different times and for different reasons. We were chatting last night about how we balance each other out, and used the TV situation as an example. She pointed out that even though I didn't lose my cool, she could see that I was emotionally maxed out for a while. She on the other hand, was calm through that particular event. There are times when she has totally lost her shit, and I was the calm one to help back her up and take the stress off. So we are also learning and growing through this experience, and finding ways to be stronger partners as a result.\n\nAnyway, wishing you all well on your own journeys.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Today is our son's 10th birthday.. husband's behavior making me feel sick to my stomach\n\nMy husband has always acted jealous of our son.  We have 2 children together, our daughter who is 13, and our son who turned 10 today.   We have been married 13 years (& together for 20).  My husband used to make dinnertimes at home so unbearable because our son wasn't a very good eater and he would get on his case endlessly at every single meal.  My husband started this when our son was a baby, and he harassed him every meal up until the past 1-2 years or so when my son slowly changed and started eating better on his own. Meals aren't perfect, he still watches our son like a hawk at meals looking for any behavior to correct or remind him to keep eating but it's a big improvement.\n\nSo now the big issue is my husband has this weird way of communicating with our son that he has never done with our daughter.  For example,  when our son talks,  he acts like he couldn't understand a word our son said and acts like our son spoke gibberish.  My husband will basically mock him by repeating some gibberish phrase back but never respond to what our son is sharing (both of our children speak 100% clearly- no speech delays or problems-and I never have any issues hearing what he said). Another thing my husband does when our son talks is constantly try to make him feel small/poke lots of holes in his ideas when he shares them,  almost like he enjoys this.   He doesn't usually do this to me or to my daughter and just listens to what we have to say/ has a regular conversation about it. But for our son he makes a point to try to make him seem like he doesn't know what he's talking about or will find something he said to ridicule him. \n\nWhen my daughter was young we had a conversation about not making fun of her speech as it was developing as a rule and most definitely no name calling and we stuck to that rule with her, but he doesn't grant the same to our son. Today is our son's 10th birthday and I called my husband in the morning when he got to work to tell him he forgot to tell our son happy birthday before he went to school (he's in the 4th grade).  My husband's response was we celebrated it yesterday so he doesn't feel bad (I wasn't calling to guilt him,  I was just letting him know). \n\nThis evening I took my son to our daughter's basketball game and we got home later than usual, around 8:30.  He was seeing his dad for the first time today and while we were snuggling and talking about the day he was born lovingly,  my kept calling out son a turd repeatedly.  I was trying to share hugs/ happy moments and my husband just kept on with the name calling It was really grossing me out and I talked to my husband that it's gross/juvenile/obnoxious for a grown man to play that way & think that name calling is funny.  It's literally giving me a horrible feeling in the pit of my gut as I write this out.  My husband got pissed at me and said I'm too sensitive and to leave him alone for the next 2 weeks while he studies for finals.  \n\nHubby isn't physically abusive but I am beyond worn down with him not listening when I say I don't like what he's doing to our son.  I've given him 10 years to stop and while it's getting slightly better in ways in others I just don't see it changing as far as the communication dynamic he has going on rn. He refuses to go to therapy,  says \"I'm the best dad\" yadda yadda I know he isn't the worst but my God he could definitely step it up in the parenting area. I don't want to raise our kids without him but I don't know what's gonna be more damaging in the long run.  I'm getting into therapy for this,  but I couldn't get in until after Christmas.  I'm looking at jobs and houses out of state cause the way he acts like a bully makes me not like him if feel this bad feeling in my gut when he's around or i think about him. I'm losing respect. \n\nThere was another man at the trampoline park we took my son to yesterday who called his son a gross name and it makes me sick to see grown men bully their sons and try to play it off like it's just a funny joke he has going with his son.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "This is going to seriously impact your son‚Äôs self-esteem and confidence into the future.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Son abruptly dropped his best friend, do I tell his mom why?\n\nMy son abruptly dropped his best friend of 3 years and I need advice on how to navigate this. \n\nMy son, Ben, is almost 6. He‚Äôs been ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù with Will, 6, since they met as toddlers at preschool. Between school and summer camp, they‚Äôve spent the majority of the past 3 years together. We‚Äôve had issues in the past with Will being aggressive and a bit mean towards Ben. It seems to come and go, and Will‚Äôs parents are somewhat aware of it, though they‚Äôre extremely permissive about it. Our nannies are wonderful and keep a close eye on the boys because of this. I‚Äôve always told Ben that he can stand up for himself, and if he wants to take a step back with this friendship we‚Äôll support him.\n\n We recently went out of town with Will‚Äôs parents, and left the boys with the Nannie‚Äôs. Apparently Will was awful to my son, constantly hitting and kicking him. Calling him ugly and a loser. After hearing this, I checked our playroom camera to see what happened and it broke my heart. Will was constantly ripping toys out of my son‚Äôs hands, getting in his face, stepping on his lovie, and at one pointed grabbed my son by his shirt and threw him to the ground as hard as he could. Will is much bigger than Ben. My son wasn‚Äôt doing anything, it was all unprovoked. \n\nWill has an older brother who is 10 and has ODD and Autism. I mention this because I think the way Will treats Ben is a reflection of how Will is being treated by his older brother. At the end of the day, I don‚Äôt care where the behavior is coming from, I won‚Äôt allow my son to be bullied. \n\nWhen we got home from the trip, my son said he never wants to see Will again. My son said his friends in his class at school don‚Äôt treat him like Will does and he‚Äôd rather be with his ‚Äúnice‚Äù friends. Luckily they‚Äôre in different classes at school and don‚Äôt see each other until pick up. My husband and I are obviously supportive of this. We‚Äôve cancelled all shared activities and I‚Äôve been telling Will‚Äôs mom that Ben is sick, though she texts me every few days asking when we can resume our weekly playdates. \n\nThe issue I‚Äôm having is what to tell Will‚Äôs parents. Both nannies think I should lie and keep saying he‚Äôs sick and see if Ben changes his mind. Worth noting that both nannies also babysit Will and his brother. Will‚Äôs mom is so stressed out over his older brother and the nannies think this will crush her.  I know it will crush her too. She‚Äôs a very sweet woman and has become a dear friend. I want to tell her the truth, mostly so she can talk to Will and get ahead of this before he ends up being the school bully. They had another friend from preschool that stopped coming around for the same reason. I‚Äôm an anxious person in general and I hate hurting someone‚Äôs feelings. I‚Äôm dreading this convo and could use some advice on what to say.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : My kid is an asshole and I want to send her away.\n\nMy daughter is 13 and she is an asshole. I know it‚Äôs a horrible thing to say about your kid but it‚Äôs true, she‚Äôs an asshole - if not narcissist or even psychopath. I really want to love my daughter and I wish I could but she‚Äôs been pushing my buttons for 13 years and I‚Äôm just done. She has exhausted me mentally and physically since the day she was born, and it‚Äôs not just me, my husband and two other daughters have had to deal with this for 13 years too. I‚Äôm not sure what went wrong with her, it‚Äôs like she came out the womb screaming and never stopped. As a baby she would scream and scream and cry until no more tears came out and her face was all red, she was crying so hard she couldn‚Äôt even breath and she would do this until she literally lost her voice from screaming so much. This went on until she was 3 or 4. I‚Äôve been taking her to doctors since she was a few months old because I knew that this wasn‚Äôt normal. The first time I took her to a psychiatrist she was just 2 years old and even they couldn‚Äôt tell me what was wrong with her. Her behaviour only got worse as she got older. She would throw things, smash things, kick, bite, hit and if you ever so much as said ‚Äústop‚Äù to her she would start screaming and shouting and kicking, sometimes she would even scratch herself. There was one occasion when she was 5 or 6 that she got really upset and started banging her forehead on a chair, the chair was cushioned so thankfully minimal damage happened before I got her to calm down. \n\nBut you get the idea, it gets worse with age and when she started school it got worse. The phone calls and emails from teachers started happening almost instantly after she started and have been going on weekly, if not daily til now. There‚Äôs always some incident when she has bitten or hit another kid or teacher, thrown something, screamed at someone, ect. The violence has also gotten worse with age, since she started secondary school (live in the UK) it‚Äôs gotten to the point where she has been to 3 different schools since starting just 2 years ago. Some examples of things that have happened are.. \n\n-her and another student tried to push a disabled boy in a wheelchair down a flight of stairs\n-attempted to rip a girls ear lobes by tearing her earrings off (unsuccessful thankfully)\n-cut off a younger boy‚Äôs bun while he was walking infront of her (she also called him the f slur when confronted by a teacher)\n-caught in and out of school on multiple occasions smoking and drinking.\n-leaves the house during the night to smoke and drink with god knows who (I‚Äôve never met any of her friends because she won‚Äôt let me)\n-when a classmate broke their hand last year during a sports game while they waited for an ambulance she attempted to stand/jump on his broken arm (she was kicked out of her first secondary school for this because unfortunately she managed to do it)\n\nI‚Äôve tried to get her a therapist but she didn‚Äôt want one and she has been seen by a psychologist but the healthcare system in England is underfunded and understaffed so it has been hard. She was given a diagnosis of ADHD but it doesn‚Äôt explain why she acts like this. I tried to ask the psychologist but he basically told me that the best thing he can recommend for me is to give her ADHD meds, which I agreed to but she refused to take them and instead took them to a meet up with friends and sold them, this is not the first incident we had of her selling stuff to her friends she has also taken makeup from me and my other daughters (both 18f), my daughters pain medication after she had surgery as well as my medical supplies for my type 1 diabetes (needles, insulin pens, ect). I have no idea why she even wanted/needed my medication and she won‚Äôt tell me. She also on regular occasions has or has attempted to steal money from me, her father or her sisters but we have learnt to hide the money and lock it away, everyone in the household except my daughter has received a lock on their bedroom door to keep my daughter out. \n\nNow that I have very briefly explained my daughter‚Äôs behaviour, the main reason I came on here is to talk about how I am going to arrange for my daughter to be sent away, she doesn‚Äôt know it yet but me and my husband and other daughters do. I am currently looking into boarding schools, specially for troubled kids as well as wilderness therapy camps for troubled teens. Me and my husband have been talking about to for the last month or so and a few days ago we officially agreed that it‚Äôs what‚Äôs best for everyone and have now started the process of applying her to places to send her to. If all goes well hopefully she‚Äôll be gone by the end of the month. Maybe I should be sad that she is leaving but I‚Äôm not, all I feel is relief; it might sound like a horrible thing to say but at this point I barley even view her as my daughter. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs just some random person that crash landed into our lives 13 years ago and has been blowing them up ever since. Maybe in the future when she grows up we can work on fixing our relationship but I‚Äôll survive if not, I‚Äôve been grieving the relationship I could have had with my daughter for so long but now i think I‚Äôve come to peace with the fact that we might never have a good relationship and it‚Äôs not from lack of trying on my part.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : What is an appropriate consequence that tells a teen I am proud but they lost my trust?\n\nPlease let me know what you would do in this situation:\n\nSo this is everything that happened, and I am proud and angry with my son, and I need help figuring out how to proceed. \n\nMy 13 year old asked to sleepover at a friend's 2 nights ago.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Strongly disagree with Dr. Becky on making kids say \"thank you\"\n\nI've seen videos of Dr. Becky telling parents that they shouldn't make their children say \"thank you\" because it's inauthentic, and instead they should encourage children to feel gratitude, which will ultimately result in children saying thank you spontaneously. \n\nAm I the only one who is totally opposed to this? To me, the point isn't to feel gratitude when you are saying thank you - I personally don't always even feel grateful when I say thank you as an adult! The point is that the person who has done the nice thing hears that they are being thanked in the moment, and is recognized for the thoughtful thing they've done. In other words, it's not about me, it's about you. Do I always feel super thankful when a barista calls my name and I go to the counter to pick up my coffee? Sometimes I'm scatterbrained and thinking about my to do list, or I'm feeling rushed and anxious for work, so no, I do not actively feel thankful in that moment! However, I know it's important for that worker to hear \"thank you\" in that moment and to feel recognized for what they've done. It feels so wrong to not thank someone in the moment just because I'm not particularly feeling it. \n\nI don't know why, but Dr. Becky's words really got under my skin and made me angry. Perhaps it's because I've been in service jobs and in other situations in life where I was working hard for other people, and every single little \"thank you\" meant something to me, even if it was delivered as an afterthought. I would be curious to know of other people agree or disagree here. \n\nFor what it's worth, I think \"please say thank you to this person for the nice thing they've done for you\" is totally okay to say to children. I would probably not want to yell it at them or anything, but I don't think it's shaming/unreasonable.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Being a dad has made my  husband grow into someone I never expected ‚Ä¶\n\nMy husband has always been a decently nice guy - typically attracted women no issues. Tall, good looking, stable job and own place. But by the time we met at 29+30 I slowly started to see his little flaws that made him still available when we met. Super hot head, road rage? Not quite, but close. Super introverted emotionally. Not always having the most romantic things to say at the right time. Always having to be right. Super competitive. \nBUT - if there‚Äôs one thing about my husband that made me fall in love with him, it‚Äôs that he was always there for me and ALWYS TRYING. With that, we fell in love, bought a house and had two more babies. (4 total). \nFast forward and now at almost 35 I sit in amazement at the human my husband has grown into. He‚Äôs made his mistakes, sure. But he never stopped trying. And through that trying he has become the most loving, calm, open and vulnerable partner - which then translated into him becoming a super vulnerable and open parent. He works daily to maintain a close connection with myself and our 4 children. There is NOTHING I am afraid\nto bring up or talk to him about anymore - whether they‚Äôre rational or irrational feelings. I have a very strained relationship with my mom, and he has become my supportive sounding board, encouraging me to do what I feel is best for myself. He has become my comfort and consolation when I need it most. A new quote he regularly says is ‚Äúparenting is 100%, some days we do 50/50, but some days you do 80% I do 20%, and others you do 20% I do 80%, or 90/10- it doesn‚Äôt matter how it‚Äôs split up and it‚Äôs constantly changing.  What‚Äôs matter is we both give what we can to support each other and they have everything they need (the kids).‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm telling you - watching this man grow and evolve emotionally has been a beautiful and admirable process. He also pushes me to be better, which he says is what I do for him. We are funny, sarcastic and like to joke around- but when the time for emotions arise, as they often do, he is 1000% there for all of us. \n\nThere‚Äôs not a day that goes by I don‚Äôt feel lucky to have found someone who completes my soul. I wouldn‚Äôt want to raise a family with anyone else.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : My mum wants pictures of my new born son's private parts\n\nMy wife gave birth to our first child three weeks ago. He's happy, healthy and we couldn't be more content with parenthood. Anyways so on the day of his birth my mum requested that i take photos of him with emphasis on getting a good shot of his \"pee pee gun\". So a bit of background, my mum isn't really a typical mother in that she was never really a nurturing caring person. She was the breadwinner in the household and her husband(my stepfather) was the one that took care of the house and essentially raised us. She was successful in her business and provided us with a comfortable standard of living, there wasn't anything we went without in a material sense but she is quite dismissive when it comes to anything emotional. So the news of her becoming a grandmother was met with mainly nonchalance but she was very interested in getting these pictures taken. My mum has always been open about her sexuality and at one point went through a swingers phase in her 50s but i find it really odd that she is now objectifying my son in this way. I don't think she's dangerous in the sense that she would sexually abuse anyone but she would routinely make people uneasy with sexual comments in social or family gatherings. I grew up with this behaviour so it never really seemed wrong to me but my wife is very upset with it and doesn't want my mum alone at all with the baby. I'm writing this post now because I've been googling around for a similar situation but couldn't come up with anything similar. I look forward to reading your opinions on this one.  \n\nEdit: \nAs to reason why my mum asked, she just says that it's just for fun. When i tell her i won't be sending any photos she calls me a party pooper. \n\nI've come to an agreement with my wife that we will not allow my mum to be alone with our son and also if it isn't clear already i will definitely not be sending any photos or pee pee guns to my mum. She has zero pee pee gun access privileges.\n\nAlso i may need therapy\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : My daughter was in a coma, 11 years later are we seeing the results.\n\nSorry for the long backstory but I believe it is the reason we are at the point we are at. When my daughter was 13 months old I was trusting my mother to babysit. It was a mistake that I will always regret. My mom is on pain medication for a car accident she had been in several years earlier. My husband and I had purchased a lock box that my mom was supposed to keep her medication in while she was watching the kids. \nOne day while I was at work I got a call she had fallen asleep and her breathing was very shallow. I left work and went straight there. I pulled up to the house my daughter stopped breathing. I started giving her mouth to mouth. She was in a level four coma. When my brother got to my mom‚Äôs house that day his son who is a year older was sitting with the unlocked pill box. \nIt became clear that my daughter had taken 300x the dose of morphine that someone her size was supposed to take. So she was placed on a ventilator to breathe for her. And life flighted to a children‚Äôs hospital. \nThankfully she woke up the next day. Much sooner than the doctors predicted. While it was the best possible news it did mean they cancelled the test they had scheduled to detect any damage that may have happened while she was struggling to breathe before she was found. \nBut the doctors told us that at any point her brain could reach its full potential and she would not be able to learn anymore. And it could happen at any\npoint until her brain is fully developed.\nShe has a brother that is one year younger and a grade lower than she is. At school they always give the kids a paper at the end of the term outlining where they are academically and where they should be. \nHer brother is right where he needs to be on everything and that is great. But she has always had trouble in math and reading. She started Jr High this year and has been really struggling. And her younger brother will tease her when he knows something that she doesn‚Äôt. Like a math equation or how to spell a word. \nSo I am struggling in if I need to sit her and her siblings down and have a conversation about why?But if I do is that going to make her feel like she isn‚Äôt going to catch up with her class ever? Is it going to take away her will to try harder? And I do understand that things are harder for her than my four other kids. She does receive extra support at school. And get extra tutoring at home. And her older siblings are always willing to help her. But she is such a happy and confident person. She doesn‚Äôt let anything hold her back. And I do not ever want to take that away from her. I want her to reach her full potential and achieve every goal she has. \nAll of my kids know that she was in a coma and why she was in a coma. If you think that you could find a vitamin or Tylenol in my house that is not locked up\nyou would be wrong.

People are dead. Two at least, but reading through the lines, I think there are more. My mom teaches at the school next door. She's there now, maybe 100 yards away. And I just... can't process it. It doesn't feel real. And part of me is like ho hum? Another day in America? And I'm doing some fucking twisted magical thinking, like if there was a shooting in the county next door to my daughter's that decreases the likelihood they'll be one at her school because, I don't know? Lightning and striking twice? And part of me thinks I'm about to homeschool my daughter forever because that's where I USED TO TEACH. Oh my god. How do I send my child to school tomorrow?

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : You ever just get a feeling about someone that you can‚Äôt shake? And it turned out true??\n\nI have zero proof, logically it doesn‚Äôt make any sense, but I will not let my toddler alone with my husband‚Äôs one uncle. He‚Äôs nice enough, love his wife, but he gives me the ick feeling. I‚Äôm dumb in a lot of ways, but being a good judge of someone‚Äôs character is a weird super power of mine. It has protected me so many times and led me to the right people so many more times. \n\nHe has 4 uncles at every single holiday. Male cousins. Etc. but there‚Äôs just one I cannot shake. When I was pregnant I felt extremely uncomfortable around him. It was the way he looked at me or approached me. The way he hugged me. I can‚Äôt explain it. I mentioned it to my husband and I was met with resistance. I had to force my husband to not let me alone while he was around. \n\nEventually after my son was born and the vulnerability of postpartum waned. I felt a bit more comfortable myself around him and no longer required my husband to accompany me everywhere when he was around.\n\nFor a bit of time I thought maybe I was just hormonal and delusional, but we saw him today, and my son is 2, and I just cannot shake it.

He walked up to us (my daughter was sitting on my lap watching the floats go by) and slapped the absolute shit out of my daughter‚Äôs face.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : 9 week old daughter hospitalised with RSV, and I'm finding it hard to control my anger.\n\nMy precious 9 week old baby girl was hospitalised yesterday with bronchiolitis caused by an RSV infection. She's on oxygen, but despite that she's still working so hard to breathe. Our eldest two came back from nursery with what we thought were colds roughly a week ago, our baby girl seemed to dodge picking it up for the first few days, but then became snotty and irritable roughly 3 days ago. Then came the nightmare that was yesterday. She wouldn't eat her morning feed, which was so crazy unlike her, then I noticed a small recession, and I mean a tiny recession but it was worrying me so I took her in to the children's A&E. They admitted her for the poor feeding, but her oxygen levels were good. \n\n\nThen 5hrs after we got on the ward I went to the bathroom, and when I came out she was coughing so hard she was going grey. The alarms were going off on the monitors and the nurses came in to provide suction. She was then put on oxygen in the early hours of this morning. That's where we're at now. My tiny little daughter is strapped up to machines and monitors. She's so tiny and innocent, and yet she's now fighting for life. I don't understand how it changed so fast. All of the nurses were saying how well she was doing to not need oxygen with RSV, and now she's suddenly on oxygen. \n\n\nI'm so angry at the situation. Hasn't she been through enough already? She already fought so hard to be here, why the hell does she have to fight again? The doctors say you don't even gain long-term immunity from RSV, so she's going through this entire hell for what? Nothing at all? Just suffering for the sake of suffering? I want to scream and lash out, but there's nobody to lash out at. Nobody is at fault here, except maybe the parents who sent a poorly child in to nursery to spread RSV around. The doctors and nurses are working so hard for her, but what if it isn't enough? What if all I get are 9 short weeks with my baby? The thought makes me sick. I sincerely hate this damn world. Just why her? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: Thank you everyone for your sweet messages, they've really helped. Little girlie is now being moved to the high dependency unit as she's been upped to CPAP, but the positive of that is she'll get a 2 to 1 nurse (1 nurse to 2 patients, rather than the current ward which is 4 patients to 1 nurse). She also seems to have an easier time breathing on the CPAP compared to the High Flow. Hopefully this means she'll get the rest she needs, now that her little body isn't working so hard. \n\n\n\nUpdate 2: The kindness and warmth from everyone has been astounding. I might not have replied to every comment, but I have read them all and it has helped so much to know other people are wishing her well ‚ù§Ô∏è Little one has now got a burst of energy from somewhere and is fighting her CPAP with some venom, so they've prescribed a sedative.  Whilst it isn't the greatest to have her pulling and swatting at the tubes, it is wonderful to see that energy and fight in her. \n\n\n\nUpdate 3: Baby girl was taken down to room air this morning, but kept on her bubble CPAP. Unfortunately though she wasn't quite ready, and her work of breathing massively increased again very quickly, so she's back on 25% oxygen. Which I've been told isn't a huge amount, but still a bit sad she isn't on room air anymore. I think I got my hopes up that she'd turned a corner faster than she had. At least things seem to be moving in the right direction though, as she's been stable for 12hrs now ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n\n\nUpdate 4: CPAP is off, and baby girl is just working on her feeding now ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Our (7F) has being showing extreme discomfort around BIL\n\nI've added an update to this post since many of you messaged me wanting to know what happened.

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where whenever we‚Äôre heading over to their place or to somewhere where he may be, she‚Äôll always ask if he will be there, & every time we say yes, she looks down disappointed. Once, she didn‚Äôt even want to wear a dress bc he was going to be there.\n\nShe‚Äôs never acted this way around anyone else, he‚Äôs known our daughter since she was a baby. He was always so good w our daughter. Last year, SIL & BIL started taking our daughter to church, daughter wanted to go out of curiosity & we didn‚Äôt see the harm in it, so we let her go, plus we trust our SIL. Sometimes after church , SIL would take her to their house to play since they also have a 1 year old. This is around the time my daughter started to express discomfort around BIL.\n\nI‚Äôve asked her different ways to try to figure out why she feels this way towards him , and the only thing she‚Äôs said is she doesn‚Äôt like the way he looks at her, she said it‚Äôs made her feel very uncomfortable. I asked her flat out if he‚Äôs EVER touched her in any way & she immediately said no, but whenever she talks to me, I get the sense she is holding something back bc she always hesitates when talking about it.\n\nIt‚Äôs gotten to the point where this past weekend we went to my in-laws and BIL and SIL were there and my daughter was being extremely quiet, she wouldn‚Äôt talk to anyone, to the point MIL and SIL were asking me why she was being like that. I‚Äôve noticed she‚Äôs more moody lately as well. She used to play around a lot w BIL, but we‚Äôve also noticed that has decreased as well.\n\nMy daughter has begged me not to say anything to SIL (she‚Äôs very close to her) , my husband wants to confront BIL bc he is fuming at the possibility of something possibly being done to our daughter (understandably so), but idk what‚Äôs the right thing to do!. Its difficult bc his family is all very close and I could see why my daughter wouldn‚Äôt want to let us know but how can I talk to her in a way where she‚Äôll tell me what‚Äôs really going on ? I want to protect my child at all costs but at the same time I don‚Äôt want to betray her confidence.\n\nShe obviously hasn‚Äôt gone to SIL‚Äôs since then but idk what to say to my SIL if and when she asks why our daughter hasn‚Äôt gone.

Their parents were very reasonable and none of them showed any intention to sue. On the contrary, they apologised for their kids coercing my daughter into doing so. Everyone is grounded. no phones, no electronic devices, no pocket money until September. They'll be volunteering at different (it's best to separate them) homeless shelters in the next 4 months every weekend, my daughter included. We have a family therapy session this Friday scheduled. Thank you everyone for commenting and genuinely caring.**\\]**\n\nI have 2 kids, one's 15 and the younger one's only 6. I woke up on Thursday realising my whole month of adhd meds were gone. I always store them in the same place and there's no way I misplaced them. I asked my wife and she had no clue either. Then I realised my daughter was acting very defensive when I asked (without accusing her of stealing) if she had any idea where the pills were.\n\nMy wife went through her bags and found the empty pill box and a stack of loose fivers in her wallet.\n\nI am very disappointed and also don't know what to do. She has never done anything like this before. I have to wait at least a week to get a refill and I'm really struggling with work. To be honest, I don't even have the energy to discipline her or be mad at her at the moment. I'm so tired.\n\n**edit**: Thank you everyone for commenting and giving insightful advice. My wife had a long talk with her and she said that *her classmates had been purchasing nootropics from dodgy websites with no known source*. I guess this is her way to seem cool and do her friends a huge favour. This doesn't make it any better of course, and we're contemplating getting the police involved. She doesn't seem to understand how serious and selfish her actions were. Also, it's completely my fault for not having my pills stored securely. *I did have them in a locked box*. But you know how you can easily learn how to pick a lock from youtube. I never thought she'd do something like this. I can't focus on anything and I have so much work due Monday, reaching the breaking point, mentally. I don't know what I'd do without my wife. She's really understanding and handled most of the talking for me. Once I get my meds, I'll be more involved with this and there's no way I'm letting this slide. We'll schedule a family therapy session asap and also contact the parents of the kids she sold to.\n\nI'm aware adhd is highly inheritable, and we had both of our kids tested. So far, neither of them have shown signs of adhd. But I am always looking out for signs, as girls tend to mask harder than boys, and they go undiagnosed more often.\n\nThank you again.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : My heart is broken for my 10yo daughter\n\nLast night my poor daughter broke down in tears saying that she just wanted to be younger again.  Like a full-blown ugly crying and hyperventilating sort of breakdown.\n\nOnce I finally got her calm enough to elaborate between short breaths, she just said all her friends just want to be pretty and wear makeup and have the perfect clothes, and maybe even talk about being a model or cheerleader...stuff along those lines.  \n\nI genuinely thought she liked these things: she uses my wife's makeup all the time and started buying her own with her allowance money.  She asks my wife to take her shopping for clothes.  All that stuff.  But when I probed more, she says she only does that stuff because she wants to fit in, and what she *really* wants is to play football with me in the yard and play video games and not care about boys and being grown up.\n\nAt that, I broke down a bit myself and squeezed her as tight as I could, and told her that she can do all of those things she wants to do, that she is in control of her life, and she should be her own person and doesn't have to worry about being popular or fitting in.  I also said that she's almost certainly not the only girl who feels this way and that we could help set up playdates if she has other less...*shallow?*...friends.\n\nMy heart is completely broken for her.  I didn't expect this so early.  What can I do besides be supportive?\n\n*edit: I won't change it above, but I will edit here since many others have commented.  I didn't use the word \"shallow\" with my kid to describe these girls.  Nor do I think she is superior in any way because her interests don't align with these girls who have completely unintentionally caused her grief.  I've spent plenty of time around these girls and they are perfectly good kids.  Rather, I was pissed at the world and at the scenario and didn't express it properly above.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : What age is right to be left home alone for a couple of hours?\n\nMy entire family has contracted strep throat. First my older son 8 then my older daughter 7 then my youngest son 4 and now me. I started developing symptoms this afternoon and made an appt with my Dr to get a strep test done. Time comes and I tell my oldest to get ready and he said he didn‚Äôt feel well and asked me if he could stay home and sleep. I was hesitant since this would be his first time home alone but after thinking about it I remembered that I was first left home alone at his age and he‚Äôs almost 9. When I was 9 I would walk to the park the bus the corner store etc by myself so I figured hed be fine plus he has a cellphone so he can call me if he needs me. I tell him to keep the door locked and don‚Äôt answer it for anyone and if he has a problem to call me. He nodded his head and then went back to sleep. I locked the door and left. Well while I was gone my in laws decided to drop by without calling and used their emergency key to go inside while I was gone and were shocked to see my son home alone. They called me yelling at me for leaving him alone and I had to leave my appt before even getting tested to deal with this. Am I wrong here? In our state there is no min age to be home alone (I checked before I left) so it‚Äôs not a legal issue. I feel like 8 is old enough for a Dr appt length of time but maybe I‚Äôm missing something.\n\nUpdate- for context\n\n1. I took my other 2 with me. My 4yo is level 2 nonverbal autistic and I would not put that kind of responsibility on an 8yo. \n\n2.

I‚Äôm not 100% comfortable with it but they‚Äôre my husband‚Äôs parents. When they drop by it‚Äôs usually just to drop something off or pick something up. \n\n3.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Home Alone With Toddler, Almost Died, Husband Completely Shut Down\n\nMy husband has never been great at handling any sort of trauma or conflict. He had a traumatic childhood, his parents had an awful divorce, there was parental alienation by the parent who had full custody and immediately married someone who despised my husband. My husband‚Äôs inability to cope with trauma has been a contentious issue. He has been in therapy about this for years, but it‚Äôs not something he has been able to overcome. \n\nA few weeks ago, I suffered a miscarriage that lead to hemorrhaging while at home with our 2 year old who was sleeping at the time. He had been at work and got here at the same time as the ambulance. His first inclination was not to come to me, who was being attended by the paramedics, but to rush upstairs to grab our son. I passed out shortly thereafter, but was told that he had been informed that our toddler would not be able to enter the hospital, so he stayed at home with our toddler. I coded at the hospital and it took 2 hours to stabilize me for surgery. My brother and his family are the only close relatives and they were in Europe on holiday so there really wasn‚Äôt anyone he could have called to take our son. \n\nI was in the hospital for a week, during which time he mainly texted me with occasional calls during which he did not want to discuss much of what happened to me. He would discuss his day and our toddler‚Äôs day as though it was just a normal conversation and I was not on the other end in the hospital having almost died a few days before. \n\nSince leaving the hospital, I returned to our home to pack a few bags and pick up our son. I said nothing to my husband about how utterly betrayed I feel about how emotionless he has been throughout this entire ordeal. He tried to hug and kiss me and honestly, it just made my skin crawl.  I am staying with my brother, my sister in law is helping with my son while I recover. My husband thinks this is so he can go back to work, the truth is I don‚Äôt want to be near him. I haven‚Äôt been able to parent my son and I have only been cordial when speaking to him. He is suddenly a lot more attentive since I am no longer in the hospital. I feel empty and not at all myself. I have a regular therapist and realize that having come so close to death is something I need to work through with her. \n\nI‚Äôm at a loss as to how to navigate my marriage after this. I‚Äôm honestly okay with the miscarriage, I am not okay with the fact that he completely emotionally shutdown on me. He‚Äôs not a bad guy, I know this and I know he can‚Äôt help his past trauma, but I don‚Äôt think I can get over this and that this may be the end of my family. \n\nHe‚Äôs a fine father. If I thought joint therapy for us would help, I would, but he has been in therapy for this for years and there have been other situations where he just emotionally shuts down as a coping mechanism. I just don‚Äôt know what to do.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : My son's school bus skips him.\n\nMy son is in 8th grade and is autistic. We decided to use the bus for the first time this year to make mornings easier with an infant now added to the mix. But so far his bus driver has only picked him up a handful of times. She'll just skip his stop. I've had to load the baby up and drop him off late to school six times now. \n\n\nI spoke with the school about it so his lateness is excused, and I use the bus app so it shows the bus' GPS and that she is skipping his stop. But yesterday she didn't bring my son home. \n\n\nShe drove her usual route but my son ended up texting me that she skipped our neighborhood, and when he informed her she told him she wasn't turning around and we would have to pick him up at school. My husband had to leave work to get him because I was at an appointment with baby in the city over. \n\n\nI called the school, and they spoke with the bus driver who said she did drive him to his stop and he just refused to get off. However, in the app it shows she did skip his stop. I called the bus help line and they ended up transferring me to a supervisor who spoke to her, got the same story, and even confirmed with me that she was lying. \n\n\nThat was yesterday. This morning she skipped his stop again, and I called the bus help line again, and they ended up having her finish her high school route then come back and take him to school almost two hours late. \n\n\nAt this point I don't fully understand what is happening because we've never used the public school bus system before. My son is very quiet and keeps to himself because of his autism and being in middle school, so I know he's not being disruptive on the bus. Does this woman just have beef with a 13 year old?

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : My son was diagnosed with Central Precocious Puberty before he turned 2\n\nAs the title says, my son was diagnosed with CPP at 22 months old. Likely the process started around his first birthday, although the physical symptoms did not become obvious until much later. \n\nThis is a condition where the brain begins to send signals to the body that it‚Äôs time for puberty and hormone production begins at an inappropriately early age (girls before the age of 8, boys before 9). It is 10x more common in girls around ages 5-7, and is generally idiopathic (meaning no cause can be found), but in boys and in younger children the cause is generally a tumor in the brain or body. The treatment for CPP is hormone blockers until they reach a certain age. Without treatment, my son would achieve complete sexual maturity by the age of 4.\n\nEvery possible cause for my son was ruled out (no tumors or abnormalities of the brain, no genetic conditions, etc) so it is idiopathic. His doctors are flabbergasted - idiopathic CPP is unheard of in a boy so young. While I am relieved that he does not have a tumor or other condition, it leaves a lot of unanswered questions.\n\nI was wondering if there are any other parents who have experienced this?

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : My husband isn‚Äôt the dad I thought he would be\n\nMy husband and I have been together for 8 years (last one married). We always talked about our kids one day and I never for a moment thought that he wouldn‚Äôt be invested. In our relationship, it always felt like it was 50/50. We had a baby boy 10 weeks ago and his colors have really shown since. His only child syndrome has really been shining especially. When he is home, I have to ask to take a shower, ask to have him hold the baby, ask him to change diaper, ask ask ask. And then when he does what I ask, he acts like it‚Äôs a burden. Then when I am doing things like taking a shower, all I hear is our baby cry and when I come up to check, he‚Äôs on his phone while the baby is crying in the bouncer. And the second I‚Äôm back, he gives me the baby. \n\nHe also eats all of our food. If I make a grocery pick up order, all of the food is gone within three days. He will pick up food for himself or make food for himself and not me. I am breastfeeding and because I‚Äôm constantly holding, feeding, rocking, loving on our baby boy, I don‚Äôt have much time to get food for myself or hydrate.  \n\nI just wish he would DO. I wish he would act like a real parent. I never in a million years thought it would be this way. He goes to the gym everyday before he works for 10 hours. So he only gets to see his son for about 30 good minutes but even then, he doesn‚Äôt pick him up or anything. \n\nI feel so alone. I‚Äôm starting to resent him. I can‚Äôt stand to hear about his life outside of this house. I‚Äôm drowning and he has absolutely no concept of what I‚Äôm sacrificing everyday. I love our baby so much but I‚Äôm questioning if I ever should‚Äôve had him with my husband. This is not what I signed up for. \n\nWhat do I do? I feel like I‚Äôve voiced frustrations but nothing changes. I know I can‚Äôt leave him but I also don‚Äôt want anything to do with him currently. I am so lost. \n\nUPDATE: thank all of you for the advice. Even if  some of it was harsh, I needed to hear all perspectives. We had a ‚Äúcome to Jesus‚Äù meeting last night and it was a calm conversation but I was extremely transparent. He felt horrible. We agreed on a new open communication system and are going to go to couples therapy too. Hoping his actions speak louder than words. \n\nTo all of you that asked why I said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt leave‚Äù, I more meant that I won‚Äôt leave. I can‚Äôt throw in the towel this quick after 8 great years. I know marriage is hard and especially parenting, I totally see that now. üò≥ I am not a SAHM, I‚Äôm on maternity leave but going back to work soon. I know he has long work hours but we knew that going into being parents and it‚Äôs something that we have to figure out. I don‚Äôt get to come home from work and coast. So he shouldn‚Äôt either. ü§®\n\n Thank you all so much for the kind comments/messages and the empathy. You have no idea how seen it made me feel to know I‚Äôm not alone in this feeling.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : My son hasn‚Äôt been the same since he took acid\n\nAs a toddler, my son was a lot to handle. Constant tantrums, rambunctious behavior, just completely emotionally volatile compared to my other kids. In preschool/kindergarten, he had some conduct issues. One time in preschool, he crushed another classmates finger with a wood block.\n\nIn elementary school, things started looking much brighter for him. He was still generally stubborn and emotional, but much more calm and less impulsive. He fell in love with reading. Always came home with those giant cat books. We learned he was intellectually gifted and placed him in an APEX program. \n\nWhile he was in middle school, I felt very proud of the young man he was becoming. Stellar grades, socially matured and developed, and overall a great kid to be around. It was around that time he started getting into politics. We loved debating each other over random current events and topics. \n\nThe pandemic happened right as he was graduating 8th grade. One day I was getting ready for work when I saw him walking around the house aimlessly. Obviously something was up, so I confronted him and he told me that he was on LSD. I asked him where he got it and he said he ordered it on the dark web. I was absolutely shocked. I asked him why he took it and he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù I just assumed it was a stupid teenager decision. \n\nFor the later half of 2020, I took away his internet access. I‚Äôm not exactly sure if I can pinpoint his behavior to his psychedelic experience, but he gradually started being more and more strange. He became very quiet. Always looked like he was in deep thought. Or not thinking of anything at all. He stopped hanging out with his friends. He mostly stayed in his room for a majority of high school. His grades have always been perfect, and now he‚Äôs graduating in the top 1% of his class. Even though I don‚Äôt ever see him doing homework. I mean he‚Äôs a good kid. Basically a nerd. \n\nHe doesn‚Äôt really talk to me at all anymore. Doesn‚Äôt want to hang out with me. Or his mother and siblings. I ask them and they don‚Äôt know either. \n\nI‚Äôve asked him dozens of times if he‚Äôs ok or if anything is bothering him. We‚Äôve never been extremely close, but I always let him know that he can tell me anything. Every single time, he quickly glances at me with a fake smile and says ‚Äúi‚Äôm fine‚Äù and then returns back to staring out into an infinite void. I ask if he ever wants to see a therapist or a psychologist, and he‚Äôll get a little defensive. Acts like I‚Äôm prying into his soul or insinuating that he can‚Äôt mentally take care of himself. \n\nHe‚Äôs never acted up since the LSD incident, so I‚Äôve never had a reason to force him to see someone professional. I‚Äôve had the thought many times that he continued to abuse drugs sneakily after that day, but I‚Äôve never found anything. The occasions that i did drug test him, it was always negative. I just don‚Äôt know what happened to him. Or why he won‚Äôt tell me. His personality is just null. I don‚Äôt know who he is at this point.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : I think my 14 year old daughter might be pregnant\n\nI badly need some advice here. I'm 41F and my daughter is 14F. I think she might be pregnant.\n\nWe have a drawer in our bathroom specially for menstrual products, which I restock every few months. These previous few times I went to restock, I noticed the amount of products has stayed the same. I know she keeps menstrual products in her backpack just in case, and her school bathrooms have free pads and tampons, so I assumed that's why she wasn't using the ones in our bthroom. She's been craving a lot of food that she's never liked before, including granola bars, almonds, rice cakes etc. I've heard her throwing up in the bathroom multiple times, and when I asked if she was alright, she just said she had a migraine.\n\nShe used to always wear form fitting shirts or crop tops, but now she almost exclusively wears loose, baggy clothes that hide her stomach. She's even stopped swimming in our pool, even though she used to love it. A few days ago, she used the swimming pool for the first time in months when she had her friends over. When I bought the girls their drinks, I saw my daughters stomach and that's when I realised how large it had gotten. I know it's not from weight gain. My daughter's always been naturally skinny and she still is; her arms and legs are still as thin as they've always been, only her stomach is bigger. I'm a chubby woman myself, I know the difference between stomach fat (soft, rolls) and a pregnant belly (smooth, round).\n\nI don't know what to do. My daughter doesn't have a boyfriend but I know she has a crush on her male best friend. I don't know how to even bring this up without embarassing her if I'm wrong. And I don't want to seem as if I'm bodyshaming her in case it is just weight gain. I'm completely lost and would greatly appreciate some advice.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "You don't have to mention weight. She doesn't seem to be using her menstrual products's, she's throwing up, and she's eating different foods. That's enough to warrant asking. And as long as you ask her privately and assure her you only want to make sure she's okay, she shouldn't be embarrassed. \n\nBut however you do it, please do it quickly. A family friend of mine lost her 15 year old daughter suddenly and found out after she died that the daughter was 7 months pregnant. It's possible the death was related to a complication with the pregnancy since she had no prenatal care."}

I often feel like I‚Äôm the default parent and hold it together pretty well.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : I‚Äôm ashamed of how I raised my kid\n\nI love my son but I failed hardcore in raising him and he is turning out to be a real trashy loser type guy. He is 16, he barely passes his classes, he's always getting in trouble, he's a stoner, he has the worst manners and he's just every stereotype of an obnoxious loser teen. I am ashamed to bring him around my middle class friends and I'm embarassed by him at most school events. I hate that I feel this way about my kid and I know it's my fault for not having boundaries for him when he was young and pretty much just letting him do whatever he wanted and letting him run feral thinking I was being a \"free range parent\". I was just being lazy. And I've completely ruined my son.\n\nWe've been through TONS of therapy the last 4 years because he was getting in fights at school and overdosed on Benadryl and Twisted Ice Teas that he shoplifted from our local grocery store because he wanted to \"see the hat man\" (classy). I have been trying to correct course and be a better mom to my son, but it's been very difficult to get him to see the value in not being stoned all the time and behaving just a little less like trailer trash. He does have two hobbies I think could be very positive, playing guitar and skateboarding, and I really try to encourage him in those areas, but he seems to pull away from anything I encourage him in. \n\nOver the past year his dad and I have scrimped and saved to send him on two school trips, a trip with his band to march in the Saint Patrick's Day Parade in Ireland, and a student exchange trip to Germany. I have had to push him into these things, he said he didn't want to do them. Honestly I assumed it was because he would have to spend several weeks not getting high and vaping, and I wanted to encourage him to step out of his comfort zone and see some of the world. This might be the only chance he ever gets to travel internationally, we are working class people and travel is not a thing we get to do. \n\nThe student he is supposed to exchange with has been here staying with us the past two weeks and I'm embarrassed about how rudely he has treated her. He barely talks to her, he never hangs out with her, this poor girl has to hang out with his parents and little siblings her whole trip. Today there was a field trip to our state capitol and while there some protest was happening and he basically yelled ACAB at some cops, in a somewhat more offensive way, and got in trouble. Then he got caught vaping at the art museum. His German teacher said he can't go to Germany now because he's a liability. My son honestly seems happy about it. Like he did it on purpose. I guess I shouldn't have pushed him into it, I guess I deserve this. I'm so incredibly ashamed my kid is the white trash kid who gets kicked out of the exchange program. I know how people talk about kids like him and what they say about the people who raise kids like this. But I would also be mortified to send him to stay with a family in Germany if he's going to behave this way there. \n\nI don't know, I feel like he needs some consequences for this, and obviously not going to Germany isn't a consequence for him. It's a reward. But it's hard not to feel like there's no point anymore. I don't want to give up on him, I'm not going to. But I don't know what else to do with him. I guess at least we will save $2500 not sending him on this trip. Maybe we can put that towards saving to send our younger kids on school trips eventually. \n\nEdit to answer some questions:\n\nFirst of all, I want to thank everyone who came in here and said even worse things about me and my son than what I was feeling in the middle of being upset last night. It actually puts things in perspective for me and helps me remember that my son and I could actually be waaaaaayyyy worse people. Thank you.\n\nSo, many of you correctly identified that there is more to this story. Of course there is. I'm not trying to write a novel about our lives on Reddit. I was venting anonymously online, precisely so that I wouldn't lose my shit and say these things to my kid. I told him that I was disappointed, that I love him, and that I needed to talk to my therapist and his German teacher before we discussed this further. I don't want to say something I will regret saying. I also told him that he can't go to the concert he has tickets for next week.\n\nHe gets money for vapes and weed by having a job. Before he had the job, he had an $8 a week allowance, but mostly he got money for this stuff by stealing things and selling them.\n\nHis grades are actually not too bad. He has a C average. He's really pulled them up since Freshman year, actually. Thank you to everyone who has given me perspective on this.\n\nWe are both in therapy. Our insurance won't cover family therapy, but he was approved for an intensive outpatient program for substance abuse after the Benadryl incident, and we did about a year of family therapy through that which was very helpful. He and I both see individual therapists, and we are getting family therapy for our daughter right now which has been paid for by the crime victim's compensation fund because she was the victim of a crime earlier this year (which is a whole other story), but in that therapy we are working on learning to set better boundaries for all of my kids, which has been very helpful as well.\n\nHe has been diagnosed with ADHD and depression, but medicating him is difficult. First off, he just won't take the meds. We have tried several anti depressants and ADHD meds and he'll take the sporadically for a week or two, declare they don't do anything, then stop taking them. He also has a history of selling stolen medications to get money for things like vapes and weed. We have worked around this by me tightly controlling all the meds in the house, but that doesn't help with his refusal to take the pills. Every 9 months or so we repeat this process, he asks to get back on meds. I take him to the doctor, we go through the whole routines, he takes them for a few weeks, he quits because he says they don't do anything. I can't make him take meds, but he is very receptive to therapy and goes every other week.\n\nAs far as consequences go, I am very aware that I'm not good at setting them. He does not have his license because of the drug use. So I've done that. \n\nHe and I are actually very close. I almost think that's a problem. He treats me like a friend, not a parent. He expects to be treated like a roommate, not a child. I know him very well. Closeness is not the issue. The fact that we don't have a parent/child relationship is. \n\nWhat do I wish I had done differently? This could be a novel, but I'll try to sum it up\n\n1. For the first four years of his life I was a single mom and we lived with my mom, who has mental health issues. When I got married to my husband (who adopted my son) and moved in with him, he had a really hard time with the transition. I thought it would help if I let him spend a lot of weekends with his Grammy. She would want to take him pretty much every weekend, and I have no boundaries with her either so I let her. At her house he had zero rules, he could watch tv all day, eat candy all day, she bought him whatever he wanted whenever, then he would come home and throw fits and tell us he hated us. In retrospect, I suspect my mom (who was bitter that I got married and moved away from her) was venting her anger at me to him. My mom did the same thing to me, but about my dad. Ruined my relationship with my dad. Anyway, I'll never know for sure. This could be a whole novel, but I have always felt my mom stole my son from me. It was a terrible mistake to have him spend so much time with his Grammy, either way. He couldn't feel like he was part of our family if he wasn't spending time with us. If I could change only one thing, this would be it.\n\n2. Less screen time, for both him and us. If we had spent less time in front of screens, we could have spent more time with him.\n\n3. Better boundaries with all the grandparents, who all wanted to spoil him and he was the only grandchild for many years on both sides and he was just lavished with stuff and never told no by anyone. My husband and I never wanted him (or any of our kids) to have tablets or phones or all the video game consoles, but both of our parents wanted to give them these things and we didn't know how to say no to our parents. Boundaries are not just things you need with your kids, it turns out.\n\n4. This one wasn't really a poor choice on our part, but I wish we had had the money for extra curriculars when he was younger. Sports or music lessons or scouts or something. We actually did try putting him in scouts and 4H but he hated them both, actually. By the time we were starting to be able to afford these things, all that money was going into therapy. Now we could theoretically afford therapy and activities, but he won't do any. I guess me forcing him into this exchange program was me trying to force him into one he shows interest in. He likes German class. But forcing him clearly wasn't a good idea.\n\n5. I wish we would have taken him camping more. And on more bike rides. And hikes. I wish I had drug him to more of the community activities I do. I just wish I had spent more time with him, and made him do things that were good for him when he just wanted to play video games. Even if he complained the whole time. Even if he threw fits in public. I wish I had worried less about people who don't want to be \"bothered\" by children in public spaces, because not taking kids out in public spaces is a recipe for them not developing good social skills.\n\nI guess that's it. I have to get my kids ready for school now. Thank you everyone for the space to vent.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Pediatrician yelled a curse word at my baby\n\nSo, my little man just turned one. He's a very happy and well behaved baby but he is still a baby, he's as well behaved as a 12 month old gets. Being that he just turned 12 months we need to take him in for his vaccinations.\n\nAt the appointment the pediatrician seemed annoyed from the very beginning. He's been rather short and seemed to be in a bad mood the last several times we've came in. The pediatrician comes into the room and sets his laptop right next to my baby. Almost immediately my baby pressed the power button. It was the closest button to the baby and he was very gentle pushing it. It turned laptop off. \n\nThe pediatrician yelled 'shit' while slamming one of his tools down right next to my baby. I apologized but tbh I was kinda scared didn't know what to do. He began mumbling under his breath more curses and left the room. He came back a minute later quickly finished the exam and left. He didn't say sorry.\n\nI didn't want to say anything to the staff. When they asked if we wanted to schedule the next appointment I declined stating it's because we were moving and will be switching pediatrician. The manger who was right there was immediately suspicious that there was something else and asked a couple of questions. We went out to the car and I couldn't find my phone so my partner ran back inside to look for it. \n\nAccording to my partner they asked if us leaving had to do with the doctor and my partner said yes and explained what happened. Apparently people have been complaining about him as of late.\n\nI'm very upset because he used to be my pediatrician and I don't want to see him fired or anything. I kinda feel bad because it sounds like he's having some personal issues. I want him get help because he's clearly not in a good place. Idk I want to hear from other parents. I was more upset that he slammed something down near my baby and that he didn't apologize. He was a good pediatrician up until this point and I've known him for 6 years. Idk I feel bad. \n\nEdit: I'm a guy.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you everyone for the advice. This has honestly made me feel a lot better. Between writing this out (therapeutic), receiving feedback, and just giving it time- I'm happy things played out like they did. Part of the reason this was so upsetting for me is because I watched a happy goofy man who has a collection of different bowties become grumpy and agitated. It's sad but not my problem. I want to answer some reoccurring questions/comments.\n\nWhy didn't I react more? I was shocked. It was a very out of character reaction, and I was caught off guard. When he came back into the room, I wanted to give him the chance to make things right, but he never did.\n\nSome people were questioning the logistics of the situation. I moved a lot as a kid. He was my pediatrician when I was 14-15 until like 18. I'm 21, I was 20 when my baby was born. \n\nAlso to the people saying that sometimes people say 'shit' or swear when something like this happens. I agree with that. We are human and have emotions. No one's perfect, and sometimes you curse. That wasn't my problem. If he just cursed and apologized for cursing, I wouldn't have a problem. I would like to clarify, he yelled shit. He **yelled** a curse word and slammed something near my kid, and never apologized. I'm upset he yelled shit, mainly the yelling, then didn't apologize. If I accidentally curse in front of a kid, I always apologize. It's not really appropriate, imo, to curse in front of other people's kids, but I also understand that sometimes it happens. I also think this is one of the few professions where I think cursing is highly inappropriate to curse. This last part is just my opinion, but I want to clarify what upset me. \n\nI would also like it address the people who think this is fake? I wish lol. Tbh if I were to make up a story, I would do it on aita on a burner- not asking for advice XD btw\n\nAgain, I would like to thank everyone for the advice. This has been very helpful. I never expected this to blow up like it did. (I expected like 10 comments, maybe) I'll update if I get an apology or if he loses his job or something. Sorry, Im unable to respond to everyone. There are just so many comments. Thanks, everyone, for the support.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Missing my son's college graduation\n\nToday is my oldest son's graduation day and I'm unable to attend the ceremony. He forgot to request tickets for his family and there were no exceptions to getting tickets after the fact. I'm really sad about this but I feel I can't show it -- my son is very upset with himself about forgetting. \n\nI really don't need any advice; just wanted to vent to strangers as opposed to family who all just give me pity party reactions. \n\nUPDATE:\nI am sitting in the parking lot of the graduation and am watching it via livestream. Why am I in the parking lot? I stuffed his car with balloons and a card and am going to give him big hugs once he gets to his car.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : Teenage boy assaulted my daughter\n\nBackstory ‚Äî my daughter (15F) is a tiny thing standing at 4‚Äô11 and has a wonderful heart and is always willing to help. A few days ago she mentioned to me that her friend (17M) is injured and is using crutches. She has been helping him get from class to class, carrying his backpack. \n\nToday I received a call from her counselor, that an incident had occurred and that her friend had gotten frustrated with the way my daughter was helping him, and he slapped her. She dropped his belongings where he was and went to security and her counselor. \n\nI feel angry and feel the need to defend my daughter. The school system doesn‚Äôt really have discipline for this besides a parent conference, I‚Äôm just worried this boy is being modeled this at home and possibly nothing will change. \n\nHow do I handle this?\n\nEDIT:: Got the full story. ‚ÄúFriend‚Äù TOLD her, not asked her, to go get his backpack out of a classroom. She did not jump up to do so, and when she got to the classroom ‚Äî the doors were locked. Meaning his belongings were locked in the classroom. She went to let him know and he stood up, slapped her, and told her ‚Äúshe had one job‚Äù. Her friends and witnesses started defending her and he defended himself and voiced him being in his right. \n\nThank you for all of your feedback. Will definitely be filing a police report.\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.

{"prompt": "Post Reddit : My daughter made me very proud\n\nMy little girl(13f) has a best friend we can call A (13f). A‚Äòs parents are divorced and A has been going through a rough time. I keep my daughter on a strict schedule when it comes to when she‚Äôs allowed on her ipad, and she sticks to her schedule and respects it very well, so I was surprised to find that my daughter had kept her ipad throughout the night when she knows she has a time she‚Äôs supposed to turn it in. I walk into her room, about to scold her for sneaking her ipad, and I see her on a call with A. I ask her to hang up the call and give me her ipad, and she does. My little girl gives me the ipad, looks me dead in the eyes and said ‚ÄúA has been cutting herself.‚Äù So I‚Äôm appalled and sit down next to my daughter and my daughter just starts spilling everything. Turns out A has been in a MUCH worse place then I thought, and my daughter has been there for her, calling her and giving her advice and comfort, sneaking her ipad, risking her privileges and risking making me angry, just so that she can make sure her friend is okay.  In my daughters words ‚ÄúIf no one else is there for her, I have to be because I know she would do the same for me.‚Äù\n\nR√©ponse du papa :", "completion": "r/parenting is protesting changes being made by Reddit to the API.
